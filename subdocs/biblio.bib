  Abstract                 = {The research presented here is a continuation of a line of inquiry that explores the impacts of an electronic portfolio software called ePEARL, which is a knowledge tool designed to support the key phases of self-regulated learning (SRL)---forethought, performance, and self-reflection---and promote student learning. Participants in this study were 21 teachers from elementary schools (Grades 4--6) and their students (N = 319) from 9 urban and rural English school boards in Quebec and Alberta, Canada, who participated during the 2008--2009 school year. Students with low enthusiasm for the use of ePEARL were excluded from the main sample as they exhibited different patterns in learning gains and self-regulatory skills as compared with those with high and medium enthusiasm. Multivariate analyses of covariance showed that students motivated to use the software made significantly greater gains compared with controls in 3 of 4 writing and reading skills (p {\textless} .01) as assessed by the constructed response subtest of the Canadian Achievement Test (fourth edition). Multivariate analyses of covariance of student survey data revealed that, over time, students who used the software reported higher levels of SRL processes than those in the control group (p {\textless} .01). Implications of the findings for school leaders and teacher educators regarding the use of electronic portfolios are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  Abstract                 = {Background

The potential role of culture in the development and operation of self-efficacy has been acknowledged by researchers. Clearer understanding of this cultural impact will benefit from research that shows how the same efficacy information is evaluated across cultures.


Aims

We tested whether two sources of self-efficacy information delivered by multiple social agents (i.e., vicarious experience and social persuasion) were weighed differently by adolescents in different cultures.


Sample

Of 2,893 middle school students in Korea (n{~}={~}416), the Philippines (n{~}={~}522), and the United States (n{~}={~}1,955) who completed the survey, 400 students were randomly pooled from each country.


Methods

Invariance of the measurement and of the latent means for self-efficacy and self-efficacy sources across the groups was tested by multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. Predictive utility of the self-efficacy sources was compared by multigroup structural equation modelling.


Results

Compared to the students in the two collectivistic countries, the US students reported significantly higher mathematics self-efficacy. Whereas the efficacy beliefs of the Korean and the US students were predicted equally well by the vicarious experience from their teachers and the social persuasion by their family and peers, those of the Filipino adolescents were best predicted by the social persuasion from their peers.


Conclusions

This study provided empirical evidence that socially conveyed sources of self-efficacy information are construed and evaluated differently across cultures, depending on who delivered the efficacy-relevant information.},

An earlier paper (Allen, Sliwinski, Bowie, \& Madden, in press) reported the factor analysis and structural equation modeling results of this study. We employed two semantic memory tasks (lexical decision and multiplication verification) using data from two different sessions (for a total of four semantic data sets), and two episodic memory tasks (hybrid visual search and memory search with digits and withwords as stimuli). For RT analyses, we found Age $\times$ Task interactions for all four episodic memory data sets, but no Age $\times$ Task interactions for the four semantic memory data sets. Also, the intercept (assumed to index peripheral processes) and slope (assumed to index central processes) analyses demonstrated that older adults (relative to younger adults) showed both intercept and slope decrements for episodic memory tasks, but only intercept decrements for semantic memory tasks. These data are consistent with a theoretical framework in which there are age-related dissociations between peripheral and central processes across semantic and episodic memory.},

Self Description Questionnaire -- I (SDQ I). Manual. Macarthur, NSW, Australia: University of Western Sydney.) served as a basis for empirically deriving the SDQ I-GS. Using a sample of German students in grades 3--6 (N = 1958), the construct validity of the SDQ I-GS was tested by both a within-network approach using confirmatory factor analyses and a between-network approach examining the relations of self-concept to external validity criteria (academic achievement and self-concept factors of another instrument). Construct validity for both the full (SDQ I-G) and the short version (SDQ I-GS) was consistent. Hence, the SDQ I-GS was demonstrated as a shorter and yet psychometrically sound instrument for measuring the multiple facets of self-concept of German preadolescents. The production of an economical instrument may stimulate wider use of self-concept instruments to further advances in self-concept research and theory.},

To achieve this goal, a reflective thinking scale consisting of 16 items and a self-directed learning readiness scale of 41 items were applied after investigating their psychometric properties. The sample consisted of 49 fourth-year students enrolled in practice education program, divided into two groups: the experimental group, using e-portfolio strategy, and the control group, with the traditional strategy. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used. The results of the study showed statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding reflective thinking and self-directed learning readiness, and on the majority of their subscales, in favour of the experimental group. Recommendations aimed at activating the e-portfolio strategy in evaluation, in different areas and at various levels, are given in the article.

Six trained assessors scored three video portfolios. Interrater agreement was determined and assessors were interviewed. Judgments across assessors were relatively similar.

Theoretical insights about assessor scoring are discussed, and implications for optimizing the assessment procedure are described.},

He begins with a discussion of theory and method: what self-efficacy is and how it can be developed. Bandura then demonstrates how belief in one's capabilities affects development and psychosocial functioning during the course of life, underscoring provocative applications of this work to issues in education, health, psychopathology, athletics, business, and international affairs.},

E-portfolio and social networks are the latest choices that informational technologies offer. In this study, both technologies have been used at education and results have been analyzed. For that purpose, there has been integrated an e-portfolio application prepared by the researcher on Facebook, which is one of the most popular social networks of the present-day and has been made available the use of for students. The study in which there has been used Isman Instructional Design Model has been used was carried out with 10th grade students studying at Tekirdag Technical and Industrial Vocational High School in the 2nd term of 2010-2011 academic year and it lasted for 18 weeks. Personal Information Questionnaire, Academic Success Test and Attitude Scale towards E-Portfolio Process have been used as data collection tools. It's observed that the averages of doing homework given for education and level of interest towards this homework have been fairly low, the interest of students towards the homework on e-portfolio application has been found as high. It has shown that e-portfolio application is a process in which students revel in participating.

In these researches it is generally emphasized the influences of e-portfolio to the learning attitude, academic success and usage of information technologies. Purpose of Study: In this work the influence of e-portfolio supported education process to the academic successes of 10th grade students of Tekirdag Technical and Industrial Vocational High School has been studied. Within the scope of the research, e-portfolio supported education in test group in Vocational Development course and traditional in-class education was applied in control group in 2nd semester of 2010-2011 academic year. Method: Control Group Trial Model with pretest and posttest was applied. Findings and Results: While assessing the findings from the work it was benefited from SPSS 17.0 package program for statistical analyses. Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test was applied in order to see whether the difference between pretests and posttests of test and control groups. In comparison of quantitative data t-test and Mann Whitney U test was used. Conclusions and Recommendations: According to the findings obtained at the end of the research, academic success posttest scores of the students in test group was higher comparing to that of students in control group. Based on these findings it was reached to the conclusion that e-portfolio supported education process influenced the success of students in positive way.},

Portfolio, however, reveals a clear picture of the student's growth and development. This study reflects that traditional approaches to assessment of student progress in EFL writing lack indicators of students' development of the skill and aims to answer the following questions: what are the learning gains of students who keep an e-portfolio as part of an elementary-level English course and what are student perceptions about the online course, using an e-portfolio and their learning gains? For this aim, the researchers worked with two groups of students: the e-portfolio group who kept an electronic portfolio in the online elementary level English language course and the traditional assessment group who did not keep an e-portfolio. Although there were not significant differences between the post-test scores of the two groups, there were significant learning gains in both groups. The perceptions of the students in the e-portfolio group reflected that they benefited from and enjoyed keeping a portfolio. (Contains 10 tables.)},

  Abstract                 = {Although the employability of graduates is of concern across further and higher education it is particularly problematic in the arts disciplines, from which few students transition to a traditional, full-time position. Arts graduates shape their work to meet personal and professional needs, and the successful negotiation of this type of career requires a strong sense of identity and an awareness of diverse opportunities. The challenge for educators is how we might develop these capacities whilst being mindful of students{\textquoteright} dreams, which are often focused on artistic excellence and recognition. This paper reports findings from a collaborative study undertaken at four Australian universities. With a focus on developing an electronic portfolio (eP), the study involved students in classical and contemporary music, music education, music technology, creative writing and professional writing. The combination of music and writing provided points of comparison to identify issues specific to music, and those that might apply more generally. This paper reports findings related to learner identity, drawing evidence from survey and interview data. The study, which was driven by the learning process rather than the technological tool, revealed that students{\textquoteright} use of eP transitions from archive to self-portrait. Moreover, the eP emerged as a vehicle through which identity is negotiated and constructed. Indeed, the process of developing of an eP prompted students to adopt future-oriented thinking as they began to redefine their learning in relation to their future lives and careers. These findings were common to all students, regardless of discipline or technological platform.},

Hence, we analyzed the effects of instructional support in the form of prompts. The effects of different types of prompts were investigated in an experiment with four conditions: cognitive prompts, metacognitive prompts, a combination of cognitive and metacognitive prompts, or no prompts (N = 84 undergraduate psychology students). We found that the prompts stimulated the elicitation of cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies. The provision of purely metacognitive prompts did not, however, improve learning outcomes. Only the groups who had received cognitive, or a combination of cognitive and metacognitive, prompts learned more than the control group. This effect was mediated by cognitive learning strategies. The learners in the successful groups did not perceive the prompted learning strategies as more helpful than the learners of the group without prompts. It can be concluded that cognitive prompts---alone or in combination with metacognitive prompts---are an effective means to foster learning. However, additional means should be employed in order to convince the learner of the usefulness of such prompts.},

The model proposed is innovative since it is composed by (a) multivariate growth models that allow the capture of different dynamics of student performance indicators over time and (b) a factor model that allows measurement of the general latent student capability. The flexibility of the model proposed allows its applications in several fields such as socioeconomic settings in which personal behaviors are studied using panel data.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowing how to manage one's own learning has become increasingly important in recent years, as both the need and the opportunities for individuals to learn on their own outside of formal classroom settings have grown. During that same period, however, research on learning, memory, and metacognitive processes has provided evidence that people often have a faulty mental model of how they learn and remember, making them prone to both misassessing and mismanaging their own learning. After a discussion of what learners need to understand in order to become effective stewards of their own learning, we first review research on what people believe about how they learn and then review research on how people's ongoing assessments of their own learning are influenced by current performance and the subjective sense of fluency. We conclude with a discussion of societal assumptions and attitudes that can be counterproductive in terms of individuals becoming maximally effective learners.},

In addition, this study explores the dynamics of group interactions in individual blog-based environments compared with collaborative wiki-based educational activities. A learning community of 56 graduate students wrote individual blogs and weekly group summaries using a wiki environment. The posts were analyzed by identifying a post content type and explicit feedback promotions, and by counting the number of the blogger's own comments and the number of others{\textquoteright} comments per post, received from peers studying in the same versus the other offline group. The results show that choosing the appropriate type of post content (i.e., sharing experiences rather than providing information, explicitly calling for feedback, and providing the blogger's own comments) augments peer interaction in a blog environment, thus explaining 51.4\% of variance in peer comments. Group interactions through comments in individual blogs, without the possibility of changing one another's content, seem to be non-intrusive and prompt interactions with offline as well as with online peers. In contrast, actual editing of texts through multi-authored collaborative wikis remained affected by student offline former acquaintance. The results are discussed in terms of social interactions and pedagogical beliefs. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Our understanding of self-regulated learning has been informed by three schools of thought: (1) research on learning styles, (2) research on metacognition and regulation styles, and (3) theories of the self, including goal-directed behavior. Based on these schools of thought, a three-layer model is presented. The innermost layer pertains to regulation of the processing modes. The middle layer represents regulation of the learning process. The outermost layer concerns regulation of the self. Educators and researchers would benefit from an integration of these three frames of reference into a comprehensive model of self-regulated learning.},

Toutefois, le monde complexe de l{\textquoteright}{\'{e}}tude en classe engendre une situation o{\`{u}} diff{\'{e}}rents buts entrent en concurrence aux yeux des {\'{e}}l{\`{e}}ves. Le mod{\`{e}}le d{\textquoteright}autor{\'{e}}gulation {\`{a}} double processus de Bookaerts montre que les deux objectifs que sont l{\textquoteright}{\'{e}}tude et le bien-{\^{e}}tre interagissent. Nous estimons que lorsque les {\'{e}}l{\`{e}}ves ont acc{\`{e}}s {\`{a}} des strat{\'{e}}gies autonomes bien au point se traduisant par de bonnes habitudes de travail, ils ont une plus grande probabilit{\'{e}} de se motiver pour les {\'{e}}tudes et de sauvegarder leur bien-{\^{e}}tre quand une source de stress bloque l{\textquoteright}apprentissage. There is no simple and straightforward definition of the construct of self-regulated learning. Theorists in educational psychology have narrowed the scope of students{\textquoteright} capability to self-regulate through a focus on the academic side of education, namely on learning and achievement goals. However, the messy world of classroom learning creates a situation in which different goals compete for students{\textquoteright} attention. Boekaerts{\textquoteright} dual processing self-regulation model describes how learning goals interact with well-being goals. We propose that when students have access to well-refined volitional strategies manifested as good work habits, they are more likely to invest effort in learning and get off the well-being track when a stressor blocks learning. Shifting definitions of SRL have led to changing measurement procedures; researchers moved away from decontextualised measures of SRL to domain-specific measures and then on to context-sensitive measures. The validity and reliability of the first generation of SR assessment has been limited and several issues remain. Recently, researchers have designed assessment packages including new instruments that better capture self-regulation as a process (including for example traces of mental events, situational manipulations, and records of student work strategies). A combination of instruments is preferable over a single instrument for assessing self-regulation as a process and the effects of interventions to improve students{\textquoteright} self-regulatory capacity. At present, many sound SRL interventions exist and some general lessons can be learned about classroom intervention research.},

A transdisciplinary approach is a key component of sustainability science. However, there are considerable barriers to implementing transdisciplinary projects. We undertake a mixed quantitative and qualitative analysis of peer-reviewed sustainability science studies where the transdisciplinary approach has been applied. We assess the growth and scientific impact of transdisciplinary sustainability research, the methods used and how three key characteristics of transdisciplinarity research---process phases, knowledge types and the intensity of involvement of practitioners---are implemented. While transdisciplinary research is growing there is no common glossary, no focused communication platform and no commonly shared research framework. Transdisciplinary research utilizes a broad, but not clearly defined, set of methods for knowledge production. While the intensity of practitioner involvement varied within the case studies analyzed, very few realized empowerment. Based on our review of transdisciplinary case study papers we conclude that transdisciplinary research must be clearly framed, including the use of a common terminology and the development of a broad suite of appropriate methods. Despite the challenges highlighted here, science needs to move beyond classical disciplinary approaches and should consider interdisciplinary work that engages with practitioners to achieve sustainable transitions.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper focuses on the conversion of disused burial grounds and cemeteries into gardens and playgrounds in East London from around the 1880s through to the end of the century. In addition to providing further empirical depth, especially relating to the work of philanthropic organisations such as the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, the article brings into the foreground debates regarding the importance of such spaces to the promotion of the physical and moral health of the urban poor. Of particular note here is the recognition that ideas about the virtuous properties of open, green space were central to the success of attempts at social amelioration. In addition to identifying the importance of such ideas to the discourse of urban sanitary reformers, the paper considers the significance of less virtuous spaces to it; notably here, the street. Building on Driver's work on {\textquoteleft}moral environmentalism{\textquoteright} and Osborne and Rose's on {\textquoteleft}ethicohygienic space,{\textquoteright} this paper goes on to explore the significance of habit to the establishing of what Brabazon called {\textquoteleft}healtheries{\textquoteright} in late-Victorian East London.},

Portfolios provide students with opportunities to demonstrate competence and are ideally suited to document and reflect on workplace-based learning experiences. In fact, portfolios have been successfully used to document evidence of achieving all the learning outcomes of an undergraduate medical program, demonstrating the diversity and potential of this learning and assessment tool. While the popularity of this educational tool continues to gain momentum, it is widely accepted that portfolio assessment requires a considerable investment of human resources and time. Medical students in a 6-year program are introduced to portfolio-based learning and assessment in their third year of training and each subsequent year until graduation. Portfolio-based learning and assessment are within reach of countries attempting to improve the quality of health sciences education using available resources.

  Abstract                 = {As part of the Tertiary Education Commission{\textquoteright}s e-Learning Collaboration Development Fund, Massey University, the Auckland University of Technology, the Open Polytechnic of New Zealand and Victoria University of Wellington have been contracted to develop an electronic portfolio application for the New Zealand tertiary sector. To provide a context for the development of the electronic portfolio application and guidelines for its use, a review of the literature on electronic portfolios and more traditional paper-based portfolios has been conducted. This literature review focuses on portfolio use in tertiary education institutions in general. However, as teacher education is the field most advanced in thinking about portfolios (as acknowledged by other disciplines (e.g. Davies, Khera, \& Stroobant, 2005; Grant, Kinnersley, Metcalf, Pill, \& Houston, 2006)), most of the general statements about portfolios are drawn from the education literature. Pinsky and Fryer-Edwards (2004, p. 585) go so far as to say that medicine {\textquotedblleft}must learn from the field of teacher education where teachers in training have adapted the portfolio approach to make the activity of teaching visible{\textquotedblright}. Research on electronic portfolios in particular is fairly new, though, again, most studies so far have focused on their uses for the learning and development of preservice teachers (Milman \& Kilbane, 2005; Sherry \& Bartlett, 2005). Barrett and Knezek (2003) make the argument that electronic portfolios should be electronic versions of paper portfolios. The same thinking about purpose, pedagogy and assessment lies behind both kinds of portfolio. With this in mind, the discussion will begin with portfolios in general: the different types of portfolio; their uses; their benefits; problems, issues and tensions that arise relating to their use; and the essential elements that need to be present in their design to ensure their success as learning, development and assessment tools. This section concludes with a discussion of their uses in a variety of disciplines. Following this, electronic portfolios will be discussed in depth: how they differ from traditional portfolios, their benefits, and issues relating to their use. In adopting electronic portfolios as a medium for student learning, certain criteria ensure success and several barriers to implementation exist. In addition, several educational and technical considerations are inherent when adopting an electronic portfolio system.},

It examines whether e-portfolio has a similar positive effect on improving speaking skills as it does on writing skills. The study was carried out with 17 students in an English Language preparation department of one of the universities in Turkey. The students were given two assignments depending on the units covered in their listening and speaking courses. They were required to prepare and video record or audio record their assignments, and upload them to www.lore.com, which was used as an e-portfolio platform. To collect data, interviews, self-assessment papers, and cover letters were used. The collected data were analyzed using content analysis. Results show that e-portfolio is equally effective in Turkish EFL learners speaking skills as it is with their writing skills.

  Abstract                 = {Inspiration is a state, evoked from some source, which creates a form of approach motivation within an individual to work toward a goal, usually associated with a creative task or product. Previous research has explored inspiration as a trait which varies in the level of intensity and frequency that one is inspired by a given source. The present research views inspiration from a social identity perspective. In Study 1, we examined the associations between ingroup identification and both state and trait inspiration. In Study 2, we manipulated salient group identity and examined ingroup identification as a mediator of salient identity and felt inspiration. In Study 3, we manipulated outgroup comparisons to examine inspiration change. Combined, the present research offers insight into how one{\textquoteright}s group influences how ingroup members are inspired.},

Commencing with a summary of their role from EDUCAUSE, whose mission is to advance higher education by promoting the intelligent use of information technology, the distinctive characteristics of ePortfolios are outlined and salient differences from conventional portfolios in terms of process and outcomes are explored. Having considered the attributes of a mature ePortfolio, the paper focuses on pedagogical and technological issues for students and staff to move to mature ePortfolios. While accepting the valuable role ePortfolios can play in higher education, and that students increasingly come to the tertiary sector with expectations and experience that appear to warrant this approach, the paper concludes that decision making in this area is not yet adequately supported by research. Educators need to be open to the promise ePortfolios offer their students and staff but be aware of the implications for their adoption.},

There were 41 students, with 18 males and 23 females. The experiment lasted 10 weeks, and students used e-portfolios to reflect on their learning. The results showed that students after using e-portfolios to reflect on their learning had significantly better self-regulated learning than before. This indicates that using e-portfolios for reflection enhanced self-regulated learning. It also shows that high-reflection students had significantly better self-regulated learning than moderate-reflection and low-reflection students, which implies that reflective performance had a significantly positive effect on self-regulated learning.

According to estimated effect size, the most significant indicators were reflection, self-assessment, continuous improvement, goal setting, problem solving, data gathering, work and peer interaction. However, peer-assessment performance was not enhanced significantly. Therefore, one recommendation was to reduce peer-assessment and instead offer specific illustrations to the students as well as the opportunity to drill.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent years have seen growing interest in electronic learning portfolios (e-portfolios) as a tool to support student learning across higher education in both public and private colleges and universities. The concept of an e-portfolio is multifaceted--it is a technology, a pedagogical approach, and a process, as well as a product. Its purpose can range from tracking development within a program to finding a job or monitoring performance. The e-portfolio efforts at Stanford have been widely distributed across schools and departments on campus. While many of these projects, courses, and programs have not formally used the term "e-portfolio," most share similar themes that are broadly related to capturing and documenting aspects of a student's learning and engaging in some form of reflection, rationale building, or planning, depending on the discipline. These activities contribute to a culture of "folio thinking," a pedagogical approach that focuses on designing structured opportunities for students to create e-portfolios and reflect on their learning experiences. In fall 2010, Stanford University initiated a pilot introducing e-portfolios to assist with the advising of students in their first two years prior to declaring a major, to learn from students and advisors how e-portfolios and folio thinking can enhance their face-to-face interactions. The pilot explores the possibility that persistence can be improved through the active involvement of others (mentors, alumni, family, peers) in the lives of students as facilitated through the medium of e-portfolios.

  Abstract                 = {Background

In recent years, there have been increasing calls to develop a more contextually based sociocultural perspective of achievement motivation.


Aim

This mixed-methods study examined why Jamaican undergraduate students are motivated or unmotivated and how this relates to the extant literature on achievement motivation.


Sample(s)

This study was conducted in two phases and consisted of 175 and 189 Jamaican undergraduate students across phases one and two, respectively.


Methods

First, a qualitative investigation using open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews explored Jamaican undergraduate students{\textquoteright} conceptualization of motivation and the factors that positively or negatively impacted their motivation. The second phase consisted of using prototype theory to capture a hierarchical cognitive representation of Jamaican students{\textquoteright} motivation using coded themes derived from phase one of the study.


Results and conclusions

The overall results indicated that personal, cognitive, contextual, and sociocultural factors are important determinants of Jamaican undergraduate students{\textquoteright} academic motivation and that sociocultural (e.g., familial, economic, religious) factors appear to play a more critical role in impacting their motivation.},

  Abstract                 = {This article describes a training program, Self-Regulation Empowerment Program (SREP), that school professionals can use to empower adolescent students to engage in more positive, self-motivating cycles of learning. It is a two-part approach whereby self-regulated learning coaches (SRC) (a) use microanalytic assessment procedures to assess students' self-regulation beliefs and study strategies and (b) train students to use these strategies in a cyclical, self-regulation feedback loop. Ultimately, students learn how to set goals, select and monitor strategy effectiveness, make strategic attributions, and adjust their goals and strategies. The program was developed from social-cognitive theory and research and integrates many of the essential features of the problem-solving model. Interventions used in the SREP include graphing, cognitive modeling, cognitive coaching, and structured practice sessions. A case study is presented to illustrate procedures for implementing the program. Implications for school psychologists and teachers also are presented and discussed. {\copyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Psychol Schs 41: 537--550, 2004.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The widely recognized need for students to self-regulate their behavior and learning extends to the multiple dimensions of professionalism. Aim: This study examines the extent to which students self-regulate professionalism behaviors related to work habits and interpersonal skills in a PBL setting. Methods: Formative feedback on works habits and interpersonal skills provided by peers and tutors to a Year 1 cohort (n = 32) over the course of a year-long PBL experience (5 blocks) was examined for comments on targeted areas for improvement (TAFIs) and observed improvements. We examined congruence between PBL feedback and students{\textquoteright} self-reported TAFIs and behavioral improvements in their assessment portfolios. Results: Both PBL peer and faculty feedback and portfolio self-assessments targeted Interpersonal Skills TAFIs more frequently than Work Habit-related issues. TAFIs were more frequently identified midway in PBL blocks versus the end. Students reported TAFIs in their portfolio essays, citing feedback from both peers and tutors, and provided evidence of improved performance over time. Conclusions: Students utilized external formative feedback to document their portfolio self-assessment in a system designed to support self-regulation of PBL professionalism-related behaviors. A decrease in TAFIs identified at the end of PBL blocks suggests students made use of mid-block feedback to self-regulate behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

We begin by providing a better understanding of the concept of a portfolio by discussing its meaning, purpose, and uses in different contexts as well as the role of technological innovations, which paves the way for new practices in developing portfolios. This is followed by a comprehensive discussion about the use of electronic portfolios in light of recent research in order to provide an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of using e-portfolios. Current research suggests that e-portfolios are practical tools for supporting self-directed and reflective learning. In addition, e-portfolios have the potential to support collaborative learning among learners who are interested in sharing their works and in gaining feedback. At the end of the chapter, we discuss an approach to designing professional learning and development plans, which serves as a guide for individuals who are interested in taking control of their own professional learning and development.

  Abstract                 = {The authors used self-regulated learning (SRL) as a lens for examining teachers' conceptions of assessment and their classroom assessment practices. Fifteen upper-elementary and middle school teachers participated in semistructured interviews designed to uncover their beliefs about the forms and functions of classroom assessment. Observational data were collected in the teachers' classrooms. The findings show that while teachers have complex understandings of classroom assessment, their assessment environments are not optimal for supporting students' development of SRL habits. Teachers tend to see themselves as the initiators and controllers of assessment opportunities, prioritize attainment of content information, and value written assessment products over practices that generate intangible data. The authors describe these trends as consequences of the competing audiences teachers have to satisfy with their assessment practices.},

This article deals with the question of whether teaching portfolios are used in higher education, and if so, which effects they bring about. Furthermore, the attitude of teachers towards the use of teaching portfolios is examined. The study shows that currently not very many teachers are using teaching portfolios. When used, a teaching portfolio is an instrument that can bring about some important positive effects. Respondents report that, due to the use of portfolios, they were stimulated to reflect on their own teaching, to actualise the learning content, to improve their course materials, to search for alternative educational methods, etc. When teachers are using teaching portfolios it is important that, besides any negative effects, they also experience positive effects. If this is not the case, teachers will see the teaching portfolio only as an extra administrative inconvenience.},

Although counsellors were the most common source of support for educational issues, very few students sought their assistance for career issues, choosing to turn to family members instead. Logistic regression revealed that males and students with lower occupational aspirations were more likely to avoid seeking assistance from counsellors for educational planning issues, while males, students with lower educational aspirations, and students with parents who attained higher levels of education were least likely to see counsellors for career planning. These results indicate that it is important to more fully explore student, counsellor, and contextual infl uences on help-seeking in the career domain, in order to design alternative intervention strategies for individuals who do not seek assistance from their school counsellors.},

Indications drawn from semi-structured interviews with N = 108 experts (39 lecturers and 69 as excellent nominated students) from 4 fields of study are in line with core assumptions of the proposed model. Moreover, the results provide a basis to ensure the content validity of assessments of students{\textquoteright} SRL competencies and from which to derive standards to judge these competencies.},

We answered the question using an holistic approach aimed at giving a panoramic perspective on the role of e-portfolios in placement from the point of view of users as well as academics and policy makers. Within the constraints of time and resources, we believe we have made a worthwhile contribution to our primary objective of supporting placement unit users{\textquoteright} capacity to make informed choices about implementation of e-portfolios.

A literature review of both published and {\textquotedblleft}grey{\textquotedblright} material informed us of the issues and therefore questions to ask. These were put into a survey that was sent to forums that placement academics and administrative staff would be likely to access, such as ASET and PlaceNet mailing lists. Additional views were obtained in interviews with key staff in institutions that were engaged in e-portfolio development and/or innovative assessment in placement. We reviewed commonly used packages used to deliver personal development planning (PDP) in institutions. We gave access to one of the more common e-portfolio packages to a group of students and allowed them to develop their own e-portfolios, and conducted a focus group to explore their views on the utility of an e-portfolio product to them.},

This increase in the complexity of our theoretical propositions regarding behavior parallels recent methodological advances for the analysis of change., These new analysis techniques have fundamentally altered how we conceptualize and study change. Researchers have begun to identify larger frameworks to integrate our knowledge regarding the analysis of change. One such framework is latent growth modeling, perhaps the most important and influential statistical revolution to have recently occurred in the social and behavioral sciences. This paper presents a basic introduction to a latent growth modeling approach for analyzing repeated measures data. Included is the specification and interpretation of the growth factors, primary extensions such as the analysis of growth in multiple populations, and structural models including both precursors of growth, and subsequent outcomes hypothesized to be influenced by the growth functions.},

It presents the statistical basis for LGM and its various methodological extensions, including a number of practical examples of its use. It is designed to take advantage of the reader{\textquoteright}s familiarity with analysis of variance and structural equation modeling (SEM) in introducing LGM techniques. Sample data, syntax, input and output, are provided for EQS, Amos, LISREL, and Mplus on the book{\textquoteright}s CD. Throughout the book, the authors present a variety of LGM techniques that are useful for many different research designs, and numerous figures provide helpful diagrams of the examples. Updated throughout, the second edition features three new chapters---growth modeling with ordered categorical variables, growth mixture modeling, and pooled interrupted time series LGM approaches. Following a new organization, the book now covers the development of the LGM, followed by chapters on multiple-group issues (analyzing growth in multiple populations, accelerated designs, and multi-level longitudinal approaches), and then special topics such as missing data models, LGM power and Monte Carlo estimation, and latent growth interaction models. The model specifications previously included in the appendices are now available on the CD so the reader can more easily adapt the models to their own research. This practical guide is ideal for a wide range of social and behavioral researchers interested in the measurement of change over time, including social, developmental, organizational, educational, consumer, personality and clinical psychologists, sociologists, and quantitative methodologists, as well as for a text on latent variable growth curve modeling or as a supplement for a course on multivariate statistics.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The paper explores whether the question of why some countries are able to implement more extensive reforms is closely related to the question of why some countries have better institutions than others. We analyze this question by using an empirical econometric model based on Poisson regression with cross-section data covering 51 states in the US, 13 provinces in Canada and 51 other countries. In the course of the study, we check the validity of three important arguments of New Institutional Economics (NIE) for the power market liberalization process. The first argument is the {\textquotedblleft}path-dependency{\textquotedblright}. To test its impact on the reform progress, we try to explain whether the background of the chairperson of the regulatory agency when reforms started or that of the governor/minister responsible for energy policy at that time has an impact on the subsequent reform progress. The second argument is the impact of {\textquotedblleft}democracy{\textquotedblright} as an institution on the reform progress. We look at the effect of two important indicators of democracy (i.e., civil liberties and political rights) on the reform progress. The final argument of NIE is about transaction costs. We concentrate on the level of corruption in a country as one of the key factors that determine transaction costs and try to explore its impact on the reforms. The results show that the backgrounds of the chairperson and the minister/governor, the level of democracy and corruption in a country are significantly correlated with how far reforms have gone in that country. The negative relationship between reform progress and civil liberties may indicate that reforms may be limited in democratic countries with strong civil society institutions such as trade unions or other organized structures in the society that may consider reforms as {\textquoteleft}harmful{\textquoteright} to their self-interest.},

  Abstract                 = {Connect to Learning (C2L) is a FIPSE-funded project coordinated by LaGuardia Community College (CUNY) that links ePortfolio teams from 24 campuses nationwide into a supportive community of practice. Launched in 2011, C2L focused on exploring and documenting ePortfolio strategies to advance student, faculty, and institutional learning. Working together, the C2L community has developed a rich resource website, Catalyst for Learning: ePortfolio Resources and Research (http://c2l.mcnrc.org), that offers data, strategies, and expertise from C2L campuses. Our work has addressed two overarching questions: (1) "What difference can ePortfolio make?" and (2) "What does it take for ePortfolio to make a difference?" Focused on the first question, this article examines C2L findings through three propositions: (1) ePortfolio initiatives advance student success; (2) making student learning visible, ePortfolio initiatives support reflection, social pedagogy, and deep learning; and (3) ePortfolio initiatives catalyze learning-centered institutional change. Based on an array of evidence from campus practices and narratives--along with the C2L Core Survey, administered on campuses across our network--C2L findings advance our collective understanding of the power of integrative ePortfolio practice and its potential to support student, faculty, and institutional learning. Moreover, these findings offer multiple avenues for further research, analysis and theory-building. We believe the future of ePortfolio depends in part on our collective ability to gather, analyze, and share evidence of the difference ePortfolio initiatives can make and, therefore, offer these preliminary findings for broad consideration, testing, refinement and improvement.},

Because of the competitive job market for new graduate nurses in health care, the development and use of an ePortfolio can be an essential tool for the application and interview process. The purpose of this paper is to report the use of ePortfolio presentations in a course at Indiana University, Bloomington campus. The implementation of an ePortfolio for seniors grew out of the previous practice of students displaying their work in a three-ring binder. As technology progressed the portfolio presentation practice grew into the use of a digital portfolio template, and then more recently, the ePortfolio emerged and was implemented through the online course management system offered by the university. Students were asked to write a reflection about their assignments, and overwhelmingly choose the resume and portfolio assignments as the most valued in the course. The experience is invaluable for the students as they exit the BSN program and launch their careers as professional registered nurses.},

To that end a model was developed, respecified, tested, and cross validated using path analyses.

We explore the path dependence of compensation systems in Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries prior to transformation and after the fall of state-socialist regimes. The results show that while major complementary institutions such as extensive state-socialist-type social welfare systems, which enhanced the developmental path during the state-socialist period, are non-existent during transformation, several factors on the macro, organisational and individual levels preserve the path. In addition, there are indications that the path dependence of pay practices in the region studied is moderated by a number of exogenous and endogenous sources of change, namely foreign parent companies of international subsidiaries, international management consulting companies, the growing importance and skill levels of HR professionals and generational change.},

Methods The KOALA programme allows residents to record their obstetrical, surgical, ultrasound, and ambulatory patient encounters and to document critical incidents of learning or elements of surprise that arose during these encounters. By prompting the student to reflect on these learning experiences, KOALA encourages residents to articulate questions which can be directly pursued through hypertext links to evidence-based literature. Four Canadian residency training programmes participated in the pilot project, from February to May 1997, using a dynamic relational database with a central server. All participants completed the Self-directed Learning Readiness Scale and a learning habits questionnaire. The impact of the KOALA programme on residents{\textquoteright} perception of their self-directed learning abilities was measured by comparing KOALA-naive schools (schools 2, 3, and 4) with school 1 (exposed to the KOALA prototype for 1 year). Ordered variables were compared using the Mann--Whitney U test and continuous variables with the Student t test (statistical significance P {\textless} 0$\cdot$05). Results During the study period, 7049 patient and 1460 critical incidents of learning were recorded by 41 residents in the four participating universities. Residents at the exposed school (school 1) had a significantly higher perception of their self-directed learning (P {\textless} 0$\cdot$05) and believed their future learning was less likely to be from continuing medical education (P {\textless} 0$\cdot$028), textbooks (P {\textless} 0$\cdot$04), and didactic lectures (P {\textless} 0$\cdot$011) and would be derived from a learning portfolio with online resources.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we present an International Socio-Economic Index of occupational status (ISEI), derived from the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO), using comparably coded data on education, occupation, and income for 73,901 full-time employed men from 16 countries. We use an optimal scaling procedure, assigning scores to each of 271 distinct occupation categories in such a way as to maximize the role of occupation as an intervening variable between education and income (in contrast to taking prestige as the criterion for weighting education and income, as in the Duncan scale). We compare the resulting scale to two existing internationally standardized measures of occupational status, Treiman's international prestige scale (SIOPS) and Goldthorpe's class categories (EGP), and also with several locally developed SEI scales. The performance of the new ISEI scale compares favorably with these alternatives, both for the data sets used to construct the scale and for five additional data sets.},

One method proving to be effective for gathering and organising products of teacher activity is the portfolio. This article will discuss the procedures that teachers can apply in developing their own portfolio assessment to help generate data for making decisions about teaching performance and effectiveness of their performance. The development of teacher portfolio requires planning, time organisation, and cooperation from students, colleagues, parents, and supervisors. The format of the portfolio may vary from individual to individual and be based upon personal choice. Portfolios provide a convenient insight into both the content and methods of instruction used by the teacher and by doing so add a significant qualitative dimension to many existing teacher evaluation systems.

Because of this shared feature, creativity may lead to dishonesty (as shown in prior work), and dishonesty may lead to creativity (the hypothesis we tested in this research). In five experiments, participants had the opportunity to behave dishonestly by overreporting their performance on various tasks. They then completed one or more tasks designed to measure creativity. Those who cheated were subsequently more creative than noncheaters, even when we accounted for individual differences in their creative ability (Experiment 1). Using random assignment, we confirmed that acting dishonestly leads to greater creativity in subsequent tasks (Experiments 2 and 3). The link between dishonesty and creativity is explained by a heightened feeling of being unconstrained by rules, as indicated by both mediation (Experiment 4) and moderation (Experiment 5).},

  Abstract                 = {The Linguistic European Policy stresses the importance of linguistic diversity and encourages students to learn several languages, believing that the more languages we know, the better we can understand each other and preserve our languages. To preserve diversity and to value all the languages (either included in the curriculum or not) is a first step to develop a plurilingual and intercultural competence in the classroom as a means of overcoming frontiers between languages and between people. A second step is to work with teachers and to value what they know by helping them to find new and innovative answers to meet these professional challenges. Thus, this paper describes the work within a project for professional development of a group of in-service language teachers. The teacher education programme suggests a portfolio-oriented language learning and teaching approach that promotes plurilingualism. We will analyse the teachers' starting point and their willingness to work within an innovative and challenging approach. The analysed data include a questionnaire prior to the starting of the programme and three written reflections at the end of the programme concerning professional development, new concepts, teaching approach and working habits. The conclusions indicate that the teachers were not familiar with either the concept of plurilingualism or the portfolio-oriented language learning and teaching approach. Nevertheless, they clearly show their willingness to try a new approach in their teaching practice. La politique linguistique europ{\'{e}}enne d{\'{e}}fend l'importance de la diversit{\'{e}} linguistique et encourage l'apprentissage de diverses langues, en croyant que la ma{\^{\i}}trise de plusieurs langues augmente la capacit{\'{e}} de comprendre les autres et de pr{\'{e}}server nos propres langues. Pr{\'{e}}server et valoriser toutes les langues (pr{\'{e}}sentes, ou pas, dans le curriculum scolaire) est le d{\'{e}}but du d{\'{e}}veloppement de la comp{\'{e}}tence plurilingue et interculturelle. Ceci constitue un moyen de d{\'{e}}passer les barri{\`{e}}res entre des langues et des peuples diff{\'{e}}rents. Un deuxi{\`{e}}me pas est le travail avec les enseignants, en valorisant leurs connaissances et en les aidant {\`{a}} d{\'{e}}couvrir de nouvelles r{\'{e}}ponses, capables de faire face aux d{\'{e}}fis de la gestion de la diversit{\'{e}}. Cet article d{\'{e}}crit le travail men{\'{e}} au sein d'un programme de formation continue destin{\'{e}} {\`{a}} un groupe d'enseignants de langues. Ce programme de formation se construit autour d'une approche plurilingue o{\`{u}} le portfolio est le concept-cl{\'{e}}. Le texte pr{\'{e}}sente l'analyse du point de d{\'{e}}part des enseignants, en explicitant leurs pr{\'{e}}dispositions {\`{a}} travailler d'une autre fa{\c{c}}on. Les donn{\'{e}}es analys{\'{e}}es incluent les r{\'{e}}ponses {\`{a}} un questionnaire ant{\'{e}}rieur au programme de formation et trois r{\'{e}}flexions {\'{e}}crites {\`{a}} la fin de ce m{\^{e}}me programme {\`{a}} propos du d{\'{e}}veloppement professionnel (nouveaux concepts, nouvelle approche, nouvelles habitudes). Les r{\'{e}}sultats montrent que les enseignants n'{\'{e}}taient familiaris{\'{e}}s ni avec le concept de plurilinguisme ni avec l'utilisation du portfolio. Toutefois, les enseignants r{\'{e}}v{\`{e}}lent le d{\'{e}}sir d'essayer une nouvelle approche dans leurs pratiques d'enseignement. La pol{\'{\i}}tica ling{\"{u}}{\'{\i}}stica europea defiende la importancia de la diversidad ling{\"{u}}{\'{\i}}stica y alienta a aprender varios idiomas, en la convicci{\'{o}}n de que cuantos m{\'{a}}s idiomas sabemos, mejor podemos entendernos y preservar nuestros idiomas. Preservar y valorar todas las lenguas (est{\'{e}}n o no presentes en el curr{\'{\i}}culum) es un primer paso para desarrollar una capacidad pluriling{\"{u}}e e intercultural en clase, que se convierte en un medio de superar las barreras entre idiomas y entre pueblos. Un segundo paso es trabajar con profesores, valorando lo que saben y ayud{\'{a}}ndolos a descubrir nuevas e innovadoras respuestas para su desarrollo profesional en momentos de cambios. Este escrito describe el trabajo llevado a cabo en el marco de un proyecto para el desarrollo profesional de un grupo de profesores en un instituto, a partir de un programa de formaci{\'{o}}n sobre ense{\~{n}}anza y aprendizaje de idiomas basado en el porfolio. Analizaremos el punto de partida de su camino y la predisposici{\'{o}}n para trabajar un abordaje innovador y desafiante del curr{\'{\i}}culum. Los datos analizados incluyen las respuestas a un cuestionario anterior al programa de formaci{\'{o}}n y tres reflexiones escritas en el t{\'{e}}rmino de ese programa, sobre desarrollo profesional, nuevos conceptos y h{\'{a}}bitos de trabajo. Las conclusiones indican que los profesores no estaban familiarizados ni con el concepto de pluriling{\"{u}}ismo ni con la ense{\~{n}}anza y aprentisage de idiomas basado en el porfolio. Sin embargo, evidencian predisposici{\'{o}}n para intentar nuevos abordajes en sus practicas profesionales. Die Europ{\"{a}}ische Sprachenpolitik legt grossen Wert auf die linguistische Vielfalt. Eine der Priorit{\"{a}}ten ist demnach, Sch{\"{u}}ler zum Erlernen mehrerer Fremdsprachen zu motivieren. Diese Idee basiert auf der Grundlage, dass das Erlernen mehrerer Sprachen nicht nur eine bessere Verst{\"{a}}ndigung zwischen Kulturen erm{\"{o}}glicht, sondern auch die eigene Sprache und Kultur erh{\"{a}}lt. Die linguistische Vielfalt zu erhalten und grossen Wert auf alle Sprachen zu legen (im Lehrplan beinhaltet oder nicht) stellt einen ersten Schritt dar, eine mehrsprachige und interkulturelle Kompetenz im Klassenzimmer zu entwickeln, zur {\"{U}}berwindung von Grenzen zwischen Sprachen und Leuten. Ein zweiter Schritt ist die Arbeit mit Lehrern, in der deren Vorkenntnisse wichtig genommen werden und ihnen damit geholfen werden soll, neue Antworten f{\"{u}}r die entsprechenden beruflichen Herausforderungen auszuarbeiten. In diesem Vortrag soll die Zusammenarbeit mit einer Lehrergruppe im Rahmen einer beruflichen Weiterbildung beschrieben werden. Das Lehrerausbildungsprogramm schl{\"{a}}gt ein portfolio-orientiertes Sprachlernen und Unterrichten vor, das Sprachenvielfalt f{\"{o}}rdert. Es soll analysiert werden, aus welchen Ausgangspunkten die Lehrer kommen und welche Bereitschaft sie zu einer innovativen Unterrichtspraxis zeigen. Die analysierten Daten, ein Fragebogen vor Programmbeginn und drei schriftliche Reflexionen am Ende des Programms, beziehen sich auf professionelle Entwicklung neuer Konzepte, Unterrichtspraxis und Arbeitsmitte. Die Schlu$\beta$folgerungen zeigen, dass die Lehrer weder mit dem Konzept der Mehrsprachigkeit noch mit dem portfolio-orientierten Sprachlernen und Unterrichten vertraut waren. Andererseits deuten sie auf eine Bereitwilligkeit von Seiten der Lehrer, eine neue Herangehensweise ihre Unterrichtspraxis zu erproben.},

  Abstract                 = {Validity is a central issue in portfolio-based assessment. This empirical study used a quantitative approach to analyse the validity of the inferences drawn from a disciplinary course work portfolio assessment comprising profession-specific and learning competencies. The study also examined the problems involved in the development of the portfolios and the features of the portfolio design that had a positive effect on validity. Teachers evaluated the performance of 25 first-year university students who produced portfolios for an obligatory course in a fine arts degree. The study data comprised the 1,300 scores obtained by the students. To assess the adequacy of the portfolio in its educational context, both the students{\textquoteright} workload and their final grades were examined. The examination of the final grades and factor analyses confirmed the validity of portfolio-based assessment but also revealed the difficulty of encouraging students to reflect on the learning process, especially where higher-order learning outcomes were concerned. The students considered that the 25.49 \% increase in hours of autonomous work made the workload excessive. With a Cronbach $\alpha$ above .90, however, the use of a well-structured portfolio and a descriptive and detailed assessment system helped to compensate for the complexity of the learning outcomes and the students{\textquoteright} lack of familiarity with portfolios.

  Abstract                 = {In this tutorial paper we focus on a multi-item Latent Growth Curve model for modeling change across time of a latent variable measured by multiple items at different occasions: in the structural part the latent variable grows according to a random slope linear model, whereas in the measurement part the latent variable is measured at each occasion by a conventional factor model with time-invariant loadings. The specification of a multi-item Latent Growth Curve model involves several interrelated choices: indeed, the features of the structural part, such as the functional form of the growth, are linked to the features of the measurement part, such as the correlation structure across time of measurement errors. In the paper, we give guidelines on the specification of the variance-covariance structure of measurement errors. In particular, we investigate the empirical implications of different specification strategies through an analysis of student ratings collected in four academic years about courses of the University of Florence. In the application we compare three correlation structures (independence, lag-1, and compound symmetry), illustrating the differences in terms of substantive assumptions, model fit, and interpretability of the results.

  Abstract                 = {In October 2008, the Australian Learning and Teaching Council released the final report for the commissioned project 'ePortfolio use by university students in Australia: Informing excellence in policy and practice'. The Australian ePortfolio Project represented the first attempt to examine the breadth and depth of ePortfolio practice in the Australian higher education sector. The research activities included: surveys of stakeholder groups in learning and teaching, academic management and human resource management, with respondents representing all Australian universities; a series of focus groups and semi-structured interviews that sought to explore key issues in greater depth; and surveys designed to capture students' pre-course expectations and their post-course experiences of ePortfolio learning. Further qualitative data was collected through interviews with 'mature users' of ePortfolios. Project findings revealed that, while there was a high level of interest in the use of ePortfolios in terms of the potential to help students become reflective learners who were conscious of their personal and professional strengths and weaknesses, the state of play in Australian universities was very fragmented. The project investigation identified four individual, yet interrelated, contexts where strategies may be employed to support and foster effective ePortfolio practice in higher education: government policy; technical standards; academic policy; and learning and teaching. Four scenarios for the future were also presented with the goal of stimulating discussion about opportunities for stakeholder engagement. It is argued that the effective use of ePortfolios requires open dialogue and collaboration between the different stakeholders across this range of contexts.

  Abstract                 = {The nonlinear mixed effects model for continuous repeated measures data has become an increasingly popular and versatile tool for investigating nonlinear longitudinal change in observed variables. In practice, for each individual subject, multiple measurements are obtained on a single response variable over time or condition. This structure can be adapted to examine the change in latent variables rather than modeling change in manifest variables. This article considers a nonlinear mixed effects model for describing nonlinear change of a latent construct over time, where the latent construct of interest is measured by multiple indicators gathered at each measurement occasion. To accomplish this, the nonlinear mixed effects model is modified to include a measurement model that explicitly expresses the relationship of the observed variables to the latent constructs. A method for marginal maximum likelihood estimation of this model is presented and discussed. An example using education data is provided to illustrate the utility of the model.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid technological change, increasing globalization and a changing world of employment with multiple roles during one's professional life are necessitating a change from knowledge to learning societies. Full participation requires lifelong learning skills, meaning the ability to solve problems, work both independently and in a team, communicate effectively in all formats and on all levels, and self-direct one's learning and professional development needs. Universities need to take responsibility in preparing students for lifelong learning. While engineering and science degrees traditionally do not emphasize the importance of lifelong learning skills new programmes of study are now being introduced, often using electronic portfolios to support engagement with learning objectives and reflection. This article describes an electronic portfolio initiative that is targeted at engineering and computer science students. The initiative aims to create awareness among students on the nature and importance of lifelong learning skills, to facilitate the development of such skills and to assist students in showcasing their competence regarding these skills. Interviews with industry representatives regarding the characteristics of a lifelong learner and the values of constructing and presenting portfolios were conducted and have resulted in strong support for the electronic portfolio initiative. The article provides background on lifelong learning and electronic portfolios, outlines the design of the initiative and then focuses on feedback from industry representatives.},

The relation of structure to naturally occurring behavior was examined in 13 urban Head Start classes containing 141 children. Children in high structure classes engaged in less prosocial behavior to peers, less imaginative play, and less aggression than children in low structure classes but had slightly more friendly peer interactions. Children in high structure classes were more attentive in circle time and helped to clean up more after free play, but they did not show more independent task persistence. The latter finding suggested that high levels of adult direction produce conformity when adults are present but do not facilitate independent task-oriented behavior.},

In addition, N = 15 teacher educators were interviewed on their assessment of the portfolio method. Results suggest that the efficiency of the portfolio method depends both on personal competences and on the framing within the training program.},

  Abstract                 = {Within structural equation modeling, the most prevalent model to investigate measurement bias is the multigroup model. Equal factor loadings and intercepts across groups in a multigroup model represent strong factorial invariance (absence of measurement bias) across groups. Although this approach is possible in principle, it is hardly practical when the number of groups is large or when the group size is relatively small. Jak et al. () showed how strong factorial invariance across large numbers of groups can be tested in a multilevel structural equation modeling framework, by treating group as a random instead of a fixed variable. In the present study, this model is extended for use with three-level data. The proposed method is illustrated with an investigation of strong factorial invariance across 156 school classes and 50 schools in a Dutch dyscalculia test, using three-level structural equation modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {This article explores the idea of portfolios as a way to collect evidence of pupils{\textquoteright} learning and achievement in their language learning in the primary school. The emphasis is on portfolio work as an active and reflective process to underpin and support learning and to show evidence of achievement and progression. Pupil choice and reflexivity are essential in the process. The process can encourage learners to draw on their learning experiences across the curriculum. Whilst a means of providing evidence of learning, and for showcasing work pupils are proud of, portfolios are seen as central to and embedded in the day-to-day learning and underpinned by the principles of formative assessment. Designed to be used with other modes of assessment including the European Languages Portfolio, portfolios are in essence flexible, inclusive and a dynamic record of learning, achievement and potential for every learner. In this article, the use of portfolios from an early age as a means to promote development and learning and a way of assessing learning are inextricably linked. Teachers working to develop portfolio work, and some of their pupils, add their voices to the discussion of portfolio development towards an enhanced dialogic assessment culture.

  Abstract                 = {Assessment in learning is always of interest to practitioners, academics and researchers, and is always evolving with new implications. Alternative forms of assessment such as e-portfolios have gained recognition in documenting students{\textquoteright} learning, as it is synchronous with both product and process. Vast amount of literature narrates the relative advantages of e-portfolios across disciplines, institutions, and applications. In Malaysia, such alternative assessment practices are less explored so far in teacher education. In this study, 55 pre-service TESOL teachers from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) are required to create and maintain a personal e-portfolio. The aim of the study is to ascertain the future teachers{\textquoteright} practices with e-portfolios in their learning and to determine if these practices lead to teaching competencies. In addition, the study also aims to identify the benefits and challenges of using an e-portfolio as a tool for learning and self-assessment. Findings indicate that participants are appreciative of e-portfolios, as their performance and achievements are traced over time. It is also found that e-portfolios function as a monitoring tool, which helps the teachers recognize their learning and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Challenges are also noted, which include validity and reliability, interrupted Internet connection, negative attitudes participants, time constraints, workload and ethical issues. In terms of teacher competencies, it is found that six competencies emerge from the teachers{\textquoteright} practices of e-portfolios---(1) developing understanding of an effective teacher{\textquoteright}s role; (2) developing teaching approaches/activities; (3) improving linguistic abilities; (4) comprehending content knowledge; (5) gaining ICT skills and; (6) the realization of the need to change mindsets.

  Abstract                 = {This article considers the use of ex post (historical) simulation statistics as a means of evaluating latent variable growth models. Ex post simulation involves using the estimated parameters of a latent variable growth model to track the known historical values of an outcome of interest. Such methods of evaluating temporal models were developed primarily in applied economic forecasting and have been known for some time. This paper applies a variety of simulation quality statistics to latent variable growth models. In particular, Theil{\textquoteright}s (1966) inequality coefficient, bias proportion, variance proportion, and covariance proportion are used to gauge the simulation adequacy of growth models. An application to the study of change in science achievement using data from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth is provided to illustrate the methodology. The results illustrate the importance of using these measures as adjuncts to more traditional forms of model evaluation, especially if one is considering the use of these models for subsequent forecasting or other policy purposes.},

Strategic Help Seeking is an excellent resource for educational researchers and practitioners including teachers, school administrators, instructional designers, and reference librarians.},

  Abstract                 = {The American culture's emphasis on individualism may fail to recognize that help-seeking can be an important proactive skill in the achievement domains of school and work. While research has shown that the majority of students obtain some help from peers or instructors, the study of help-seeking as a learning strategy has been virtually neglected. This study examined how help-seeking relates to cognitive learning strategies such as elaboration, metacognition, and resource management. Data were obtained from students in biology, English literature, and social science courses at four different types of higher educational institutions. Strategy use and help-seeking information were obtained using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. The use of 10 cognitive strategies was assessed: rehearsal; elaboration; memory techniques; organization; metacognitive techniques of planning, monitoring, and regulating; and resource management of one's time, study environment, and self. The results indicated that students who used various cognitive strategies were also more likely to seek help when needed. This supports the view that seeking help is an alternative means of goal accomplishment to be used when the need arises. Students who were less likely to use various strategies were also less likely to seek the help they needed. (NB)},

Four hundred and seventy four (N = 472) students enrolled in distance, distributed, and traditional classes were queried about their help seeking preferences, help seeking tendencies, personal threat in seeking help, and academic self-efficacy. It was hypothesized that students enrolled in courses with an online computer component would report (a) higher instances of help seeking behavior, particularly from instructors; and (b) feel less threatened to seek help than students in traditional learning environments. It was also expected that student achievement would be significantly correlated with formal help seeking, academic self-efficacy, and perceived threat to seek help. Lastly, it was postulated that students would report that they prefer to use electronic means to seek help and that they find it more effective. Overall the hypotheses of this study were supported. Educational implications and recommendations are provided regarding the type of technological tools that college instructors might consider using in their courses to promote help seeking.},

  Abstract                 = {In this article, a heterogeneous latent growth curve model for modeling heterogeneity of growth rates is proposed. The suggested model is an extension of a conventional growth curve model and a complementary tool to mixed growth modeling. It allows the modeling of heterogeneity of growth rates as a continuous function of latent initial status and time-invariant covariates. A quasi-ML parameter estimation method and a likelihood-ratio test for heterogeneity of growth is developed, and the new methodology is applied to an empirical example on math achievement data. The example illustrates that the proposed model gives more accurate confidence intervals for the prediction of future math achievement than a conventional growth curve model and identifies the subgroup of subjects which show the most homogeneous growth.},

  Abstract                 = {Metacognition is an integral component of a self-regulated approach to learning. The present study examined the relationships between academic self-efficacy and perceptions of one's own competence in memory and reasoning abilities, and their role in predicting the Self-confidence trait. The study also aimed to determine the role of key classroom factors (goal orientation and self-efficacy with the teacher) in predicting self-beliefs, the Self-confidence trait and academic achievement in Year 6 students (N = 177). EFA and Path analysis were used to determine these relationships. The hypothesised path model was tested in a simultaneous fashion of the entire system of variables to determine whether or not hypothesised relationships were consistent with data. The results suggest that academic self-efficacy and metacognitive competency beliefs define a broad factor---Metacognitive Beliefs---which serves as a key predictor of Self-confidence. Mastery goal-orientation and self-efficacy with teacher predicted Metacognitive Beliefs and, indirectly, Self-confidence. Students with stronger Metacognitive Beliefs were less engaged in self-handicapping behaviours. Known common factors---intelligence, gender and a proxy for SES, school fees---were controlled for. The present study has important implications for both metacognitive theory and educational practice.},

  Abstract                 = {Some electronic portfolios (EPs) developers are proposing that EPs are suitable for implementation in primary education (i.e. kindergarten to grade three). Yet, empirical research evaluating the implementation and efficacy of EPs used in primary school settings at both the teacher and the student level is scarce. In this research, the authors attempted to implement EPs in grades one, two and three (approximate ages 6 through 8). EPs were reviewed to make the EP selection and in-depth collaborative planning with the teachers ensued. The main challenges for teachers and students were at the user interface level. Results from this cautionary tale suggest that implementation of EPs in primary education may be premature. While much potential exists in EPs, it has yet to be realised. Recommendations for improving EPs are suggested. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Data from a sample of individuals with intra-articular fractures of the lower extremity from the University of Alabama at Birmingham{\textquoteright}s Injury Control Research Center is analyzed using both SAS PROC MIXED and SPSS MIXED. We start our presentation with a discussion of data preparation for MLM analyses. We then provide example analyses of different growth models, including a simple linear growth model and a model with a time-invariant covariate, with interpretation for all the parameters in the models. More complicated growth models with different between- and within-individual covariance structures and nonlinear models are discussed. Finally, information related to MLM analysis such as online resources is provided at the end of the paper.},

Findings indicated that students from the showcase portfolio group (Group B) were less enthusiastic about the effectiveness of PA, and queried whether it could promote autonomy in writing, while the working portfolio group (Group A) was more receptive to the experience, and considered that a feedback-rich environment in the working portfolio system could facilitate writing improvement.

  Abstract                 = {Background

A comprehensive understanding of the contextual factors that are linked to student engagement requires research that includes cross-cultural perspectives.


Aims

This study investigated how student engagement in school is associated with grade, gender, and contextual factors across 12 countries. It also investigated whether these associations vary across countries with different levels of individualism and socio-economic development.


Samples

The participants were 3,420 7th, 8th, and 9th grade students from Austria, Canada, China, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Malta, Portugal, Romania, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States.


Methods

The participants completed a questionnaire to report their engagement in school, the instructional practices they experienced, and the support they received from teachers, peers, and parents. Hierarchical linear modelling was used to examine the effects at both student and country levels.


Results

The results across countries revealed a decline in student engagement from Grade 7 to Grade 9, with girls reporting higher engagement than boys. These trends did not vary across the 12 countries according to the Human Development Index and Hofstede's Individualism Index. Most of the contextual factors (instructional practices, teacher support, and parent support) were positively associated with student engagement. With the exception that parent support had a stronger association with student engagement in countries with higher collectivism, most of the associations between the contextual factors and student engagement did not vary across countries.


Conclusions

The results indicate both cultural universality and specificity regarding contextual factors associated with student engagement in school. They illustrate the advantages of integrating etic and emic approaches in cross-cultural investigations.},

Two sets of questionnaires were used for understanding students' approaches of learning and perceptions of online discussions. The online postings from seven weeks of discussions were coded into three major categories: Initiation, Elaborated Response (ER), and Response with Resources (RWR). The results showed, first, some aspects of students' perceptions influenced the numbers of ERs and RWRs. Secondly, students' contributions to Initiation messages and RWR significantly related to deep motivation and deep strategies; however, the numbers of these two types of messages were negatively correlated to surface strategies. Finally, cluster analysis revealed three distinct groups who scored significantly different in almost all aspects of approaches to learning and perceptions of online discussions. Students in the cluster who adopted deep approaches and scored highest in the perception scales outperformed students in the other two clusters, both in terms of the number of ER messages and academic performance. Pedagogical implications for teaching with online discussions are discussed in this study.},

Je nach Zugeh{\"{o}}rigkeit zur experimentell variierten Trainingsbedingung erhielten die Versuchspersonen bei jedem Modul (1) kein spezifisches Training, (2) nur ein Training der Lernstrategie oder (3) ein kombiniertes Training der Lernstrategie und darauf bezogener Selbstregulation. Zur Erfassung der anf{\"{a}}nglichen Lesekompetenz bearbeiteten die Versuchspersonen vor Beginn des Trainings einen Lehrtext sowie einen zugeh{\"{o}}rigen lehrzielorientierten Test. Nach jedem Trainingsmodul bearbeiteten sie zur Anwendung der Trainingsinhalte ebenfalls einen Lehrtext, und es wurde ebenfalls anhand eines lehrzielorientierten Tests erhoben, wie viel Wissen sie aus der Bearbeitung des Textes gewonnen hatten. Die Teilnehmer des kombinierten Trainings schnitten im Vortest-Nachtest-Vergleich deutlich besser ab als die Teilnehmer des Lernstrategietrainings und als die Teilnehmer der Kontrollbedingung ohne Training. Die im Rahmen dieses Trainingsansatzes erzielten Ergebnisse entsprechen aktuellen Theorien des Trainings von Lernstrategien, die davon ausgehen, dass es sinnvoll ist, neben der Vermittlung von Wissen {\"{u}}ber einzelne Lernstrategien auch den zielf{\"{u}}hrenden Einsatz der jeweiligen Lernstrategie mit zu trainieren.

  Abstract                 = {Background

Kindergarten is the age at which children's future time perspective emerges. This capacity enables them to form goals based on past and ongoing experiences and project themselves in the future. This development may play an important role in guiding children in self-regulated learning. When faced with the conflict between their need to learn and their desire to play (CLP), children make choices based on their perceptions of CLP. However, their CLP-related perceptions and responses are also influenced by the values their culture upholds. Research shows that Western learning emphasizes more mental activities and positive affect, whereas East Asian learning stresses more social/moral self-perfection. Children's CLP-related perceptions and responses are likely shaped by their respective cultures' values.


Aims

This study examined kindergartners' emergent perceptions of and responses to CLP. Both commonalities and possible cultural differences were investigated.


Sample

The sample was 130 middle-class European-American and Chinese kindergartners, balanced for culture and gender.


Method

Children each heard a story beginning with a picture of a protagonist who is practicing words at home but hears children playing outside. Children were asked to complete the story and were probed further when they mentioned ideas related to learning and play. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed for coding. Tests were conducted for group differences.


Results and Conclusions

Most children from both groups identified CLP and shared similar views about their need to complete schoolwork, benefits of learning, negativity of neglecting learning, and ways to resist temptation to play. However, large cultural differences also emerged. Chinese children showed greater awareness of CLP and expressed more positive regard for learning, learning virtues, and receptivity to adult expectations.},

  Abstract                 = {Background

Students{\textquoteright} pursuit of academic and social goals has implications for school functioning. However, studies on academic and social achievement goals have been relatively independent and mainly conducted with students in culturally Western settings.


Aims

Guided by multiple-goal perspectives, this study examined the role of academic and social achievement goals in outcome variables relevant to academic (achievement, effort/persistence), social (peer relationship satisfaction, loneliness), and socio-academic (cooperative learning, competitive learning, socially regulated, and self-regulated learning) functioning.


Sample

A total of 356 Indonesian high-school students (mean age{~}={~}16{~}years; 36\% girls) participated in the study.


Methods

A self-report survey comprising items drawn from pre-existing instruments was administered to measure distinct dimensions of achievement goals and outcomes under focus. Regression analysis was performed to examine additive, interactive, and specialized effects of achievement goals on outcomes.


Results

Aligned with the hierarchical model of goal relationships (Wentzel, 2000, Contemp. Educ. Psychol., 25, 105), academic and social achievement goals bore additive effects on most outcomes. Findings also revealed a specialized effect on academic achievement and notable interactive effects on cooperative learning. In general, mastery-approach and performance-approach goals were more adaptive than their avoidance counterparts. The effects of social development goals were positive, whereas those of social demonstration-approach goals were mixed. Contrary to prior findings, social demonstration-avoidance goals did not appear to be inimical for school functioning.


Conclusions

Findings underscore the importance of both academic and social achievement goals in day-to-day school functioning and the need to consider the meaning of goals and the coordination of multiple goals from cultural lenses.},

  Abstract                 = {More than 20 years ago, researchers proposed that individual differences in performance in such domains as music, sports, and games largely reflect individual differences in amount of deliberate practice, which was defined as engagement in structured activities created specifically to improve performance in a domain. This view is a frequent topic of popular-science writing-but is it supported by empirical evidence? To answer this question, we conducted a meta-analysis covering all major domains in which deliberate practice has been investigated. We found that deliberate practice explained 26\% of the variance in performance for games, 21\% for music, 18\% for sports, 4\% for education, and less than 1\% for professions. We conclude that deliberate practice is important, but not as important as has been argued.},

The first is to investigate in greater detail the finding of Rogosa and Willett that the quasi-Markov simplex model fits a linear growth curve covariance structure. It is found that under various circumstances the quasi-Markov simplex model is rejected. Furthermore, the procedure is reversed by fitting the linear growth curve to quasi-Markov simplex covariance structure. It is found that the linear growth curve, like the quasi-Markov simplex, is not always rejected even though the model is formally incorrect. The second objective of this article is to present a quasi-Markov simplex model with structured means. This model, like the linear growth curve model with structured means, is based on the assumption that the variation in means and individual differences are attributable to the same causal agents. We argue that this assumption should be tested explicitly. An example is given.},

  Abstract                 = {Background

Prior cross-cultural research with students in different national contexts (Australia and China) has shown consistency in the extent to which individual personal best (PB) goals are associated with engagement at school.


Aims

This study extends this work to a multicultural context, assessing perceived PB goal structure in school and individual PB goals among Chinese- and English-speaking background Australian high school students attending the same schools.


Sample

A sample of 450 students (N{~}={~}225 Chinese-speaking background Australian students; N{~}={~}225 matched English-speaking background Australian students) from 20 schools.


Method

We conducted multigroup path modelling to examine the following process model: Perceived PB goal structure in school{~}$\rightarrow${~}individual PB goals{~}$\rightarrow${~}school engagement{~}$\rightarrow${~}academic achievement.


Results

Findings showed that for both groups, perceived PB goal structure in school is associated with an individual's PB goals (and engagement), individual PB goals are associated with engagement, and engagement is associated with achievement. The indirect effects of perceived PB goal structure in school to achievement (via individual PB goals and engagement) and individual PB goals to achievement (via engagement) were also significant. Notably, there was no significant difference in parameters between Chinese- and English-speaking background students, suggesting generality of the effects of perceived PB goal structure in school and individual PB goals in the engagement and achievement process.


Conclusion

Findings hold implications for educators teaching to culturally diverse classrooms and seeking to optimize students' academic growth within these contexts.},

Since the test is nonverbal, it can be applied to many different populations and has been used all over the world (Court \& Raven, 1995). However, relatively few matrices are in the sets developed by Raven, which limits their use in experiments requiring large numbers of stimuli. For the present study, we analyzed the types of relations that appear in Raven{\textquoteright}s original Standard Progressive Matrices (SPMs) and created a software tool that can combine the same types of relations according to parameters chosen by the experimenter, to produce very large numbers of matrix problems with specific properties. We then conducted a norming study in which the matrices we generated were compared with the actual SPMs. This study showed that the generated matrices both covered and expanded on the range of problem difficulties provided by the SPMs.},

Along the way, all portfolio makers must work out how to document that learning and how to investigate and reflect on it, in order to harness it. The advantage of the course portfolio process is that it has an inbuilt integrative learning compass, since the three elements of the portfolio, its Design, Enactment (Teaching) and Results (Student Learning), are dynamically interrelated and literally triangulate each other, one begetting, informing and critiquing the other. The course portfolio will speak loudest as community property---there to be shared with others and critiqued and built on to advance student learning.

  Abstract                 = {Growth modeling using longitudinal data seems to be a promising direction for improving the methodology associated with the accountability movement. Longitudinal modeling requires that the measurements of ability are comparable over time and on the same scale. One way to create the vertical scale is through concurrent estimation with identification of groups (Bock \& Zimowski, 1997). However, there are concerns about how well this vertical scale will function using longitudinal data with few common items between years (Briggs et al., 2008). Other concerns about the adequacy of this and other vertical scaling strategies arise when the common items shift over time. This study explores these two practical issues in application of a Latent Growth Item Response model (LG-IRM). To illustrate how psychological constructs could be tracked over time, an application to psychological data is also included. Since the number of common items between years can be few, it is important to ensure that the growth modeling procedure can produce good estimations in this situation. A concurrent estimation procedure of the scales is examined. To verify the estimability of the growth model using concurrent estimation, a simulation study is conducted. The LG-IRM is then applied to real data from the LSAY. A study of item shifts over time is also included. Models that do not consider item shifts are compared to those that do. An extended version of the Latent Growth Item Response Model is proposed in which estimates growth parameters are produced while allowing for item shift over time. Item Response Theory (IRT) has been applied extensively to research in education. Its use in modeling achievement and student ability has been demonstrated using various IRT model formulations. To a lesser degree IRT has also been applied to personality research. Although the conceptualization of the domain, the item types, and the measurement goals are often different in personality research, IRT tools can still provide valuable information. The LG-IRM also provides a way to explore questions in personality research. For instance, it can provide information on the stability of self-esteem in the Black population over time. In this study the Latent Growth Item Response Model is extended to include polytomous item types. The LG-IRM is then applied to data from a longitudinal study of Black Self-Esteem.

This chapter reports on the results of a pilot of an e-portfolio tool in an Australian university, involving different curriculum contexts across two semesters. Using a mixed methods approach, feedback was gathered from students and staff in the participating units on their perspectives about the usability of the e-portfolio tool, the support provided, and its effectiveness for their learning. The results reinforce the need for e-portfolios, like any new technology, to be embedded into appropriately designed tasks, which are seen to be engaging, relevant, and part of a fully integrated curriculum experience.

  Abstract                 = {Background

There is substantial evidence indicating that various psychological processes are affected by cultural context, but such research is comparatively nascent within New Zealand. As there are four large cultural groups in New Zealand, representing an intersection of individualist, collectivist, indigenous, colonial, and immigrant cultures, New Zealand is an important context in which to investigate the role of culture in such processes.


Aims

This study investigated goal orientation and self-efficacy beliefs among students of different cultural backgrounds in New Zealand, associations between motivational beliefs and achievement, and whether any relations differed by cultural background.


Sample

Participants were 2,210 students attending three intermediate schools.


Methods

Participants responded to a questionnaire at the beginning of the school year to evaluate self-efficacy for mathematics and mastery and performance goal orientation. Participants also completed a standardized mathematics achievement test at the beginning and end of the year.


Results

The factor structure was sufficiently invariant by cultural group, but with statistically significant differences in average level of endorsement. Self-efficacy for mathematics predicted marginally higher end-of-year achievement after controlling for beginning-of-year achievement, with a stronger relationship for Māori and Pasifika, but no statistically significant relationship with achievement among Asian students.


Conclusions

The questionnaire used was a valid instrument for the four main cultural groups in New Zealand. Differences were found in motivation levels, and Māori and Pasifika were more affected by their self-reported self-efficacy. Teachers may be able to raise students{\textquoteright} self-beliefs by conveying high expectations for these students, potentially supporting higher academic outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {This study explored the self-regulated learning (SRL) profile of upper elementary (fifth and sixth grade) school children who were differentiated in their task value beliefs (low and high) in language and mathematics. Students' SRL profile involved their teachers' ratings of achievement outcomes and SRL behaviors. The subscale of task value beliefs from the Motivational Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) was administered to the children, and their teachers completed a battery of scales and measurements concerning students' achievement and SRL behaviors. The results confirm previous evidence indicating that SRL involves high levels of motivation, metacognition, and strategic action. Furthermore, the results support the domain-specific character of task value beliefs. Differences in teachers' evaluations about the achievement outcomes and SRL behaviors regarding the two groups of students (low and high in task value beliefs) were found significant mostly in the domain of mathematics. Students with high value beliefs in mathematics were described as more cognitively, metacognitively, and motivationally competent learners as compared to students with lower value beliefs. The results suggest that future intervention studies should focus on strengthening task value beliefs in {\textquotedblleft}threatening{\textquotedblright} school subjects, such as mathematics, from the elementary school years. {\copyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Maximum likelihood estimators are derived via the Fisher scoring algorithm. An application of HLM2F to early vocabulary growth data illustrates the utility of the methodology. The methodology shown in this article has several advantages over the current two-level HLM (HLM2). Those include: (a) a parsimonious model that facilitates interplay between the theory and empirical results, (b) estimation of a deficient rank Level 2 covariance matrix, (c) calculation of change in deviance to evaluate the HLM2F model compared to HLM2, (d) construction of the distribution of a set of random effects in terms of an underlying latent factor, and (e) more efficient estimates for the variance component parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Praise for ability is commonly considered to have beneficial effects on motivation. Contrary to this popular belief, six studies demonstrated that praise for intelligence had more negative consequences for students' achievement motivation than praise for effort. Fifth graders praised for intelligence were found to care more about performance goals relative to learning goals than children praised for effort. After failure, they also displayed less task persistence, less task enjoyment, more low-ability attributions, and worse task performance than children praised for effort. Finally, children praised for intelligence described it as a fixed trait more than children praised for hard work, who believed it to be subject to improvement. These findings have important implications for how achievement is best encouraged, as well as for more theoretical issues, such as the potential cost of performance goals and the socialization of contingent self-worth.},

  Abstract                 = {This article proposes a general latent variable approach to discrete-time survival analysis of nonrepeatable events such as onset of drug use. It is shown how the survival analysis can be formulated as a generalized latent class analysis of event history indicators. The latent class analysis can use covariates and can be combined with the joint modeling of other outcomes such as repeated measures for a related process. It is shown that conventional discrete-time survival analysis corresponds to a single-class latent class analysis. Multiple-class extensions are proposed, including the special cases of a class of long-term survivors and classes defined by outcomes related to survival. The estimation uses a general latent variable framework, including both categorical and continuous latent variables and incorporated in the Mplus program. Estimation is carried out using maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm. Two examples serve as illustrations. The first example concerns recidivism after incarceration in a randomized field experiment. The second example concerns school removal related to the development of aggressive behavior in the classroom.},

Its use as an analgesic after caesarean section has recently been studied with higher dosages (400-800 micrograms). Our study aimed at assessing the analgesic and ventilatory effects of two smaller doses of epidural clonidine (150 and 300 micrograms), which were compared to the effects of 10 mg of parenteral morphine (M) during the first 3 h after caesarean section. The duration of the analgesic effect was longest with 150 micrograms of epidural clonidine. Arterial blood pressure decreased from 30 min after the injection to the end of the study in both epidural clonidine groups. A marked sedation was observed in patients receiving 300 micrograms of epidural clonidine and was frequently associated with snoring, obstructive apnoea and episodes of arterial oxygen desaturation. We conclude that 150 micrograms of epidural clonidine provides better and longer analgesia after caesarean section than 10 mg of parenteral morphine, and seems preferable to higher doses (300 micrograms) in this setting, since 300 micrograms of epidural clonidine may produce unacceptable respiratory obstructive disturbances.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive and metacognitive strategies are particularly important for learning with hypertext. The effectiveness of strategy training, however, depends on available working memory resources. Thus, especially learners high on working memory capacity can profit from strategy training, while learners low on working memory capacity might easily be overtaxed. In addition, efficient basic reading comprehension processes are important for strategy training to be successful: When both the newly acquired strategies and poorly routinized basic reading comprehension processes compete for working memory resources, navigation within the hypertext and learning might deteriorate rather than improve. In an experiment, 64 undergraduates learned with a comprehensive expository hypertext after receiving either a cognitive or a metacognitive or no strategy training. In line with the predictions, learners high on working memory capacity or reading skill could profit from learning strategy training in terms of learning outcomes and the quality of their navigational behavior. Learners low on working memory capacity or reading skill, in contrast, performed worse in both training conditions compared to the control condition. The improvement in learning outcomes for skilled learners as well as the impairment in learning outcomes for unskilled learners could be shown to be indirect effects mediated by the quality of navigational behavior.},

The differences in Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire scales between pre-test and post-test, or control group and experimental group were evaluated. The trace data of learning activity were also analyzed to evaluate the effects of the learning model on students{\textquoteright} self-regulated learning. The results show that students implemented self-regulated learning processes, and their intrinsic goal orientation, metacognitive self-regulation, effort regulation, elaboration, rehearsal, and critical thinking improved after applying ePortfolio-based learning model in the courses.

  Abstract                 = {E-portfolios show great promise for supporting students' writing performance and facilitating peer feedback, but empirical research of their use in primary education is limited. To address this gap, a yearlong study was conducted in a 4th grade primary class in Cyprus implementing e-portfolios (n{~}={~}20) to help students document their progress and send feedback to peers. A generic, open source weblog tool localized into Greek was used as an e-portfolio tool. Data sources included 176 student-essays, 1306 instances of peer feedback, students pre- and post-tests on writing performance, nine videotaped student interviews and one teacher interview. A paired samples t-test analysis showed that there was a statistically significant difference between students' pre-test (M{~}={~}62.6, SD{~}={~}9.82, n{~}={~}20) and post-test (M{~}={~}76.5, SD{~}={~}12.6, n{~}={~}20) on writing performance (t (19){~}={~}$-$8.03, p{~}\&lt;{~}.01). A repeated measures analysis of variance on e-portfolio artifacts showed that there were learning gains with respect to students' writing performance over time [F(4.01, 76.25){~}={~}31.59, p{~}\&lt;{~}.01, $\eta$2{~}={~}0.89]. A qualitative analysis of students' comments showed that students provided more thorough peer feedback over time and became gradually more capable of providing corrective feedback. The qualitative analysis of student interviews provided evidence that students valued peer feedback in their portfolios. The analysis of the teacher interview showed that average and high-ability students benefited the most from peer feedback. This study provided evidence that e-portfolios can support the development of students' writing performance and peer feedback skills in the context of primary school essay writing. Instructional implications for portfolio implementation are offered.},

In Axelrod's simulations, the simple strategy tit-for-tat did outstandingly well and subsequently became the major paradigm for reciprocal altruism. Here we present extended evolutionary simulations of heterogeneous ensembles of probabilistic strategies including mutation and selection, and report the unexpected success of another protagonist: Pavlov. This strategy is as simple as tit-for-tat and embodies the fundamental behavioural mechanism win-stay, lose-shift, which seems to be a widespread rule. Pavlov's success is based on two important advantages over tit-for-tat: it can correct occasional mistakes and exploit unconditional cooperators. This second feature prevents Pavlov populations from being undermined by unconditional cooperators, which in turn invite defectors. Pavlov seems to be more robust than tit-for-tat, suggesting that cooperative behaviour in natural situations may often be based on win-stay, lose-shift.},

This viewpoint is strongly supported by Axelrod's computer tournaments, where 'tit for tat' (TFT) finished first1. This has stimulated interest in the role of reciprocity in biological societies1-8. Most theoretical investigations, however, assumed homogeneous populations (the setting for evolutionary stable strategies9,10) and programs immune to errors. Here we try to come closer to the biological situation by following a program6 that takes stochasticities into account and investigates representative samples. We find that a small fraction of TFT players is essential for the emergence of reciprocation in a heterogeneous population, but only paves the way for a more generous strategy. TFT is the pivot, rather than the aim, of an evolution towards cooperation.},

The aims of this study were (i) to determine whether preparing a portfolio helps promote students{\textquoteright} development in a range of capabilities including understanding ethical and legal principles, reflective practice and effective communication, and (ii) to determine to what extent the format of the portfolio affected the outcome by comparing the experiences of students at two different medical schools. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate undergraduate medical students{\textquoteright} experiences of completing a portfolio at two medical schools. A total of 526 (45\% response rate) students answered the on-line questionnaire. Students from both medical schools gave the highest ranking for the portfolio as a trigger for reflective practice. 63\% of students agreed their portfolio helped them develop reflective practice skills (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas only 22\% disagreed. 48\% of students agreed portfolios helped them understand ethical and legal principles whereas 29\% disagreed (p {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, only 34\% of students thought the portfolio helped them to develop effective communication. Students perceive portfolio preparation as an effective learning tool for the development of capabilities such as understanding ethical and legal principles and reflective practice, whereas other capabilities such as effective communication require complementary techniques and other modes of assessment.

  Abstract                 = {This study investigated the effectiveness of an integrated web-based portfolio system, namely the BOUNCE System, which primarily focuses on improving preservice teachers{\textquoteright} reflective thinking skills. BOUNCE{\copyright}, the software component of the system, was designed and developed to support a teaching practice model including a cycle of activities to be performed in teaching practicum courses. The effectiveness of the BOUNCE System was evaluated by investigating the development of preservice teachers{\textquoteright} reflective thinking skills over time and the usability of the BOUNCE software. Preservice teachers demonstrated both high- and low-level reflective thinking indicators throughout the semester. A statistically significant change was detected in the number of high-level reflective thinking indicators from the first teaching experience to the second. Furthermore, the usability ratings of the BOUNCE{\copyright} were above average. These findings highlighted the importance of integrated portfolio systems that combine technological and pedagogical elements to develop reflective thinking.

Nine variations of the general model are described that differ in terms of categorical and continuous latent variable specification within and between groups.

Schools are classified into three Type B effectiveness categories based on their mean student mathematics achievement growth trajectories, controlling for differences in students' backgrounds across schools. The classification outcome is regressed on a set of school practice variables to investigate the association between practices and cognitive development. Various issues related to model specification are discussed, including the use of covariates to identify substantively meaningful classes.},

The researchers asked students, using open-ended survey items, about the advantages, disadvantages, and obstacles they faced when creating and disseminating their e-portfolios. Additionally, each student described his or her most significant e-portfolio learning experience and how to make the process more meaningful. Overall, there were seven themes: increased scope, guidance, timing, alignment with standards, reflection and growth, organization of work, and the inaccessibility of the e-portfolio system to persons outside of the university. This article discusses findings as well as practical recommendations for e-portfolio integration and ideas for future research. (Contains 6 tables.)},

Based on the studies in this article, taxonomies of different academic emotions and a self-report instrument measuring students{\textquoteright} enjoyment, hope, pride, relief, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, and boredom (Academic Emotions Questionnaire [AEQ]) were developed. Using the AEQ, assumptions of a cogni- tive-motivational model of the achievement effects of emotions, and of a control/value theory of their antecedents (Pekrun, 1992b, 2000), were tested in 7 cross-sectional, 3 longitudinal, and 1 diary study using samples of university and school students. Results showed that academic emo- tions are significantly related to students{\textquoteright} motivation, learning strategies, cognitive resources, self-regulation, and academic achievement, as well as to personality and classroom antecedents. The findings indicate that affective research in educational psychology should acknowledge emotional diversity in academic settings by addressing the full range of emotions experienced by students at school and university.},

This prompted us to assess how teachers allocate their time to different tasks over their careers. Results of a study involving 1939 German teachers from a representative school sample show that beginning teachers and those at the end of their careers engage in fewer tasks (selection). The latter also save time on demanding aspects and invest the time saved in less demanding tasks instead (optimisation), and have fewer career ambitions (compensation).},

Using the actiotope model of giftedness to integrate a broad range of research, this innovative book features a number of chapters written by internationally recognised scholars in a frank and lively discussion about the origins of exceptionality in students from East Asia. With the actiotope model as the theoretical framework, the book distinguishes between trait models of giftedness and systems approaches to exceptionality. Breaking new ground in understanding the complex interactions between a learner{\textquoteright}s environment, goals, intelligence and motivations in the development of their ever-expanding knowledge and skill set, this book will:

describe, with examples, a systems approach to the development of exceptionality, allowing educators and researchers the ability to track students with greater precision;
influence the means by which educators identify and support students with the potential for exceptional performance;
suggest possible reasons for the variability in the achievement of potentially gifted students;
provide strategies to support these students;
have a profound effect on the way that exceptionality and giftedness are defined and understood, not only in East Asia but also in the West.
Covering issues that have firm theoretical foundations and which are based on cutting edge ideas, Exceptionality in East Asia has significant implications for gifted education and is essential reading for scholars, undergraduate and postgraduate students interested in the psychological and social basis of exceptionality.},

Surprisingly, groups differing in ability and achievement in 3rd grade made parallel progress over time, and some {\textquotedblleft}fan-close{\textquotedblright} effects were found. With growth curve analysis of individual students using hierarchical linear models, initial status on cognitive ability predicted initial achievement scores but did not affect the rate of growth. Similarly, initial status in achievement predicted the intercept but not the slope in cognitive ability scores over time. Although replication is needed, this study illustrates how districts could use standardized test data to document growth of academic skills over time in high-, middle-, and low-achieving children; in racial or socioeconomic status subgroups; or in different classrooms, schools, or districts.},

Average levels of avoidance of help seeking were related to students' perceptions of the classroom goal structure: A perceived emphasis on self-improvement was related to lower levels of help avoidance, whereas a perceived emphasis on relative ability was associated with higher levels.

When students do not seek the help they need, they put themselves at a disadvantage for learning. We discuss how students' personal motivational characteristics relate to their avoidance of help seeking. In particular, we discuss our work regarding perceived academic and social competence and achievement- and social-goal orientations. We also discuss how various dimensions of the classroom context relate to help avoidance. Specifically, we discuss rules and norms of classrooms as well as our work examining the achievement goal structure and social climate of classrooms. We conclude by discussing how new developments in achievement goal theory distinguishing between approach- and avoidance-goal orientations might add to psychologists' understanding of help avoidance. We also consider how students' strivings for autonomy and different aspects of the social climate might be incorporated into theories of students' help avoidance behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this study is to analyze the factors influencing e-portfolio use in higher education and its implication on students{\textquoteright} learning. These relationships are investigated under different stimulated conditions that have offered the potential for more understanding of the influencing factors in the investigated context. University students (N = 56) attending the grades of Pedagogy (N = 25) and Nursing (N = 31) filled in two questionnaires at the end of the lesson of the course: The Revised SPQ-2F Study Process Questionnaire and AEQ Assessment Experience Questionnaire were used to measure the approaches to learning and perceptions of the assessment practice. First questionnaire was concerned the students{\textquoteright} approaches towards their own learning. Second questionnaire covered general perceptions of assessment demands including the e-portfolio assessment. The results showed positive relationship of the use of e-portfolio activities with feedback, the training with e-portfolios and the positive influence on student teachers{\textquoteright} deep approaches to learning.

This paper will focus on how the creation and implementation of e-Portfolios can help to prepare senior undergraduate students to design and realize future career pathways with the use of this electronic assessment tool. In particular, this paper will illu strate how one university has changed their focus in evaluating student learning in a strategic approach to incorporate a new type of "capstone" course for business undergraduate students. As a result, there are still students leaving educational institutions not fully prepared as to how to approach the job hunting process. This particular academic tool has been helpful for the instructor to evaluate the students' abilities and skills to apply content knowledge gained from the core business administ ration programs, as well as prepare students for their next career endeavor.},

Five evaluative dimensions based on persistence and engagement theory were included in the development of four assessment rubrics exploring goal clarity, support from friends and family, academic engagement, social integration, and quality of effort were used to assess student ePortfolios. Data collected from these five were integrated with institutional measures producing two structural equation models explaining undergraduate persistence for students returning with 2.5 and 3.2 GPAs with an explained variance of 31 and 39 percent respectively. Carefully designed interventions geared to assist students in continuing their studies as second year undergraduates are considered.

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this article is to review recent research on self-regulated learning and discuss the implications of this research for science education. We draw on examples of self-regulated learning from the science education literature to summarise and illustrate effective instructional methods and the development of metacognitive understanding (Gunstone; 1999a; Rickey \& Stacy, 2000; White \& Mitchell, 1994). We also focus on the crucial role that metacognition plays in self-regulation (Baird \& White, 1996; Nichols, Tippins, \& Wieseman, 1997; White, 1998). We divide our discussion into two main parts. The first focuses on three components of self-regulated learning, including cognition, metacognition, and motivation. We relate these aspects of self-regulation to current practices in science education. The second section focuses on six general instructional strategies for improving self-regulation in the science classroom. We focus on the use of inquiry based learning, the role of collaborative support, strategy and problem solving instruction, the construction of mental models, the use of technology to support learning, and the role of personal beliefs such as self-efficacy and epistemological world views. These instructional strategies are selected because they reflect extensive research agendas over the last decade within the science education literature and are essential to metacognition and self-regulation (Butler \& Winne, 1995; Gunstone, 1999b).},

  Abstract                 = {Multi-indicator growth models were formulated as special three-level hierarchical generalized linear models to analyze growth of a trait latent variable measured by ordinal items. Items are nested within a time-point, and time-points are nested within subject. These models are special because they include factor analytic structure. This model can analyze not only data with item- and time-level missing observations, but also data with time points freely specified over subjects. Furthermore, features useful for longitudinal analyses, {\textquotedblleft}autoregressive error degree one{\textquotedblright} structure for the trait residuals and estimated time-scores, were included. The approach is Bayesian with Markov Chain and Monte Carlo, and the model is implemented in WinBUGS. They are illustrated with two simulated data sets and one real data set with planned missing items within a scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Die Beziehung zwischen Varianten der Selbstwertschaetzung und Hilfesuche wird untersucht. In einer Fragebogenstudie und in einem Quasiexperiment wurden Daten an Stichproben von 178 Psychologie-Studierenden erhoben. Es zeigte sich, dass das Ausmass der Hilfesuche allein durch die Verwendung der Hoehe der Selbstwertschaetzung nicht vorhersagt werden kann. Wurden jedoch weitere Variablen zur Beschreibung der Selbstwertschaetzung herangezogen, konnten Aussagen zur Beziehung zwischen Selbstwertschaetzung und Hilfesuche abgeleitet werden. Es wurden Teilgruppen von Personen mit Hilfe von Clusteranalysen gebildet, die sich durch ihre Auspraegungen auf den Variablen Selbstwertniveau, Selbstwertinstabilitaet und Narzissmus charakterisieren liessen. Diese Varianten der Selbstwertschaetzung unterschieden sich in ihrer Hilfesuche. So waehlten Personen mit einer hohen und zeitlich stabilen Selbstwertschaetzung insbesondere Hilfeangebote, die sie befaehigten, aehnliche Probleme in Zukunft selbststaendig und autonom zu bewaeltigen. Personen mit einer Selbstwertschaetzung mit narzisstischen Tendenzen vermieden es haeufig, Hilfen in Anspruch zu nehmen, auch wenn das Nutzen der angebotenen Hilfen in der Situation angemessen gewesen waere. Eine weitere Teilgruppe bildeten Personen mit hoher aber zeitlich instabiler Selbstwertschaetzung. Diese nutzten meist mehr angebotene Hilfen als die anderen Gruppen. Es wird geschlussfolgert, dass sich Personen mit hoher und zeitlich stabiler Selbstwertschaetzung bei der Hilfesuche meist angemessen und adaptiv verhalten, waehrend Personen anderer Varianten der Selbstwertschaetzung zum Teil zu viel oder zum Teil zu wenig Hilfe in Anspruch nehmen.

  Abstract                 = {Teaching portfolio has been widely used in higher education as a useful management tool for monitoring and improving teaching and learning process among academicians. The usage of portfolio methods to document professional development in teaching is well known by all. However, despite its proliferation, this issue is still dogged among academicians. Time pressure, data are not integrated and not easily accessible as well as paper-based portfolio seems to be the critical factors why teaching portfolio may become a burden for any academicians. E- teaching portfolio allows all academicians to be involved in the community over network technologies with the capability to store various types of media. E-Teaching Portfolio helps in preparing evidence in supporting teaching and learning processes, as a reflective tool in enhancing their capabilities and as a way in supporting their self- assessment review. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to create a basic understanding of e-teaching portfolio in higher education prior to replace the paper-based portfolio. An action research methodology was adapted consisting of four important phases diagnosing, planning action, taking action and evaluating action. A sample prototype was created using an open-source management tool, Mahara. Mahara is a fully featured open source electronic portfolio, which was developed in 2006 by the New Zealand e-Portfolio Project funded by the NZ Tertiary Education Commission. Mahara platform was chosen in compiling and integrating all files and academician's portfolios. Furthermore, this paper will deliberate discuss the implementation of an e-teaching portfolio using the Mahara platform to support teaching and learning.},

This course emphasizes learning to learn with and about technology, in the ever-changing context of educational technology. Generally speaking, we outline and describe three key goals of teaching young teachers to thoughtfully integrate technology into a real-world classroom. First, the course emphasizes learning to explore and learn proactively by engaging in learning by design activities. Second, students are given an opportunity to try a wide variety of innovative technologies through explorations of their own choosing. Finally, we attempt to leverage the power of online community building for learning by harnessing the ubiquity and convenience of tools like Facebook. We look into the future with great hope and enthusiasm that our preservice teachers will lead the way in integrating new technologies into their teaching in ways that will benefit their students, colleagues, and the greater education community.},

It requires the investor to quantify several subjective parameters. In this article, we propose a new way of creating these views using Verbal Decision Analysis. Questionnaires were designed with the intent of making it easier for investors to express their vision about stocks. Following the ZAPROS methodology, the investor answers sets of questions allowing to determine a Formal Index of Quality (FIQ). The views are then derived from the resulting FIQ. Our approach was implemented and tested on data from the Brazilian Stocks. It allows investors to create a personal risk-return balanced portfolio without the help of an expert. The experiments show that the proposed method mitigates the impact of poor view estimation. Also, one must notice that the method is qualitative and its aim is to create a more efficient portfolio considering the investor{\textquoteright}s vision.},

  Abstract                 = {Researchers have been applying their knowledge of goal-oriented behavior to the self-regulated learning domain for more than 30 years. This review examines the current state of research on self-regulated learning and gaps in the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning of work-related knowledge and skills. Self-regulation theory was used as a conceptual lens for deriving a heuristic framework of 16 fundamental constructs that constitute self-regulated learning. Meta-analytic findings (k=430, N=90,380) support theoretical propositions that self-regulation constructs are interrelated-30\% of the corrected correlations among constructs were .50 or greater. Goal level, persistence, effort, and self-efficacy were the self-regulation constructs with the strongest effects on learning. Together these constructs accounted for 17\% of the variance in learning, after controlling for cognitive ability and pretraining knowledge. However, 4 self-regulatory processes-planning, monitoring, help seeking, and emotion control-did not exhibit significant relationships with learning. Thus, a parsimonious framework of the self-regulated learning domain is presented that focuses on a subset of self-regulatory processes that have both limited overlap with other core processes and meaningful effects on learning. Research is needed to advance the field's understanding of how adults regulate their learning in an increasingly complex and knowledge-centric work environment. Such investigations should capture the dynamic nature of self-regulated learning, address the role of self-regulation in informal learning, and investigate how trainees regulate their transfer of training.},

  Abstract                 = {As becomes apparent in the growing literature on portfolios as assessment tools, there is a wide array of definitions and interpretations of the instrument. The prospects and benefits of portfolios being discussed increasingly call for a need to distinguish between types of portfolio. In this paper four types of portfolios are compared based on their goals and setting of use. Descriptive and evaluative data were collected as a background for comparative analyses between types of portfolio and in-depth interviews were undertaken to find out about the reasons and explanations for different portfolio use by their collectors. The analyses is focused on three criteria of portfolio use as they relate to different elements of the portfolio collection process: (i) the clarity and explicitness of the portfolio collection; (ii) the feasibility of the collection process itself; (iii) trust in the outcome of what is being collected. The study indicates that feasibility considerations are mainly responsible for differences between types, linked to an uncertainty and ambiguity on the part of the collectors to engage in the process of compilation. The trust in the portfolio instrument as a valid tool to assess abilities seems hardly affected and remained high. A major concern across different types of portfolio for all users is the feedback provided and potential use of collected information.},

The main purposes of portfolios being put forward are: documentation of performance, monitoring growth, revealing discrepancies in development and enhancing self-responsibility. The findings, however, pertain to the introductory implementation of the portfolio instrument, most notably with (student) teachers. Not much is known about the sustained use of a portfolio as an instrument to support professional development in the long term. In this study the benefits of different forms of sustained portfolio use are focused on in particular. Use is related to the portfolio's function, which can be for both professional development and certification, and to the setting and conditions of use, which may be either mandatory or voluntary. We gauge its impact on indicators like ongoing documentation, systematic reflection, dialogue with significant others and learning for professional development. The difficulties experienced users found are discussed, as well as the gains they saw in sustained use of portfolios, which led us to conclude that portfolios are mainly used for documentation but have a high potential as mirrors of competence when issued as instruments for self-evaluation and self-assessment.},

In this manner, we attempted to explore the relationships between some important variables from three different, but connected phases of self-regulated learning: the forethought phase (interests), the performance control phase (learning strategies) and the self-reflective phase (causal attributions). Results confirmed the presumption that learning strategies could be a potential mediator in the relationship between students' interests and their academic achievement. Also, results indicate that the causal dimension of controllability could have a partial mediating role between students' academic achievement and their interests. Generally, our findings indicate a dynamic and cyclical nature of learning process -- interest is an integral part of this process and it could be conceptualized as both a consequence and an antecedent of cognitive aspects of learning.

Of particular value are the insights they afford to learning that has taken place over time, including through project-based learning (PBL; Barak, 2011; Chang Barker, 2005; Mason, Pegler, \& Weiler, 2004). With the introduction of digital tools, e-portfolios present ready enhanced opportunities for linking evidence to judgment. Through this chapter, we illustrate how this approach can support assessment of learning through a seamless blending between online and offline work, within and beyond classroom settings. Through the system, learners and teachers can access the portfolios at school or at home, providing and responding to formative feedback directly in the portfolio. In this way, the system enables blended learning that is practice based, capturing dynamically the evidence of learning as it occurs. In addition, this evidence is available through a Web space for summative assessment and can be accessed by a range of assessors at the same time.

  Abstract                 = {Effective help-seeking is an important strategy that is fundamental to successful learning whenever the student's knowledge or comprehension is insufficient to enable independent resolution of a problem. Nevertheless, it is often regarded with negative connotations. For distance education students, help-seeking takes place in a different context than for students in conventional education. This is characterized by limited face-to-face contact, little interaction between students, and often isolated learning. Consequently, if distance educators are to help students to make the most effective use of help-seeking strategies, it is first important to understand the nature of help-seeking among these students. This article describes a study that compared the help-seeking strategies used by students identified as high achievers in courses at the Open University of Hong Kong (OUHK) and groups identified as low achievers in an attempt to uncover any insights about successful help-seeking strategies that can be used by distance education students, specifically those in a predominantly Chinese culture. Data were collected by questionnaires completed by 712 students and telephone interviews with a subsample of 32. Although there were similarities between the two groups in help-seeking for academic difficulties, there was a tendency for more of the high-achieving students to seek help for personal difficulties relating to their courses. Several help-seeking strategies were identified.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Research on self-regulated learning (SRL) in hypermedia-learning environments is a growing area of interest, and prior knowledge can influence how students interact with these systems. One hundred twelve (N = 112) undergraduate students{\textquoteright} interactions with MetaTutor, a multi-agent, hypermedia-based learning environment, were investigated, including how prior knowledge affected their use of SRL strategies. We expected that students with high prior knowledge would engage in significantly more cognitive and metacognitive SRL strategies, engage in different sequences of SRL strategies, spend more time engaging in SRL processes, and visit more pages that were relevant to their sub-goals than students with low prior knowledge. Results showed significant differences in the total use of SRL strategies between prior knowledge groups, and more specifically, revealed significant differences in the use of each metacognitive strategy (e.g., judgment of learning), but not each cognitive strategy (e.g., taking notes) between prior knowledge groups. Results also revealed different sequences of use of SRL strategies between prior knowledge groups, and that students spent different amounts of time engaging in SRL processes; however, all students visited similar numbers of relevant pages. These results have important implications on designing multi-agent, hypermedia environments; we can design pedagogical agents that adapt to students{\textquoteright} learning needs, based on their prior knowledge levels.},

  Abstract                 = {Background. Several studies have examined young primary school children's use of strategies when solving simple addition and subtraction problems. Most of these studies have investigated students' strategy use as if they were isolated processes. To date, we have little knowledge about how math strategies in young students are related to other important aspects in self-regulated learning. Aim. The main purpose of this study was to examine relations between young primary school children's basic mathematical skills and their use of math strategies, their metacognitive competence and motivational beliefs, and to investigate how students with basic mathematics skills at various levels differ in respect to the different self-regulation components. Sample. The participants were comprised of 27 Year 2 students, all from the same class. Method. The data were collected in three stages (autumn Year 2, spring Year 2, and autumn Year 3). The children's arithmetic skills were measured by age relevant tests, while strategy use, metacognitive competence, and motivational beliefs were assessed through individual interviews. The participants were divided into three performance groups; very good students, good students, and not-so-good students. Results. Analyses revealed that young primary school children at different levels of basic mathematics skill may differ in several important aspects of self-regulated learning. Analyses revealed that a good performance in addition and subtraction was related not only to the children's use of advanced mathematics strategies, but also to domain-specific metacognitive competence, ability attribution for success, effort attribution for failure, and high perceived self-efficacy when using specific strategies. Conclusions. The results indicate that instructional efforts to facilitate self-regulated learning of basic arithmetic skills should address cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational aspects of self-regulation. This is particularly important for low-performing students.},

  Abstract                 = {Many vocational students in Taiwan have been used to a 'spoon-feeding' teaching method since they were children. They are used to following their school's and teachers' arrangements for their learning. Consequently, they usually lack the ability to manage their time and regulate their learning. If these students were to participate in an online or blended course without regulative learning habits, it may result in dissatisfactory and ineffective learning performance. In this work, two blended classes were studied and compared, one a class deploying feedback in the implementation of Web-mediated SRL and the other without. The results show that the feedback did not result in statistically significant differences in students' computing skills and their pass rate on professional certification tests. The potential reasons for the nonsignificant results and some implications of this study are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Guardians have been implicated in the development of children's academic self-regulation. In this case study, which involved naturalistic observations and interviews, the everyday practices of a working class family were considered in the context of self-regulated learning development. The family's practices, beliefs, dispositions and home structures were not aligned with conditions recognized as supporting self-regulated learning development. It is suggested that for the family to adapt or adjust home practices in a way that supports their children's self-regulation means adopting a different logic of parenting, valuing and promoting certain kinds of self-knowledge, forming different kinds of social networks, and mediating and controlling affects of occupational conditions. It is suggested that shifting home practices to teach academic self-regulation in the family's home is value-laden and reflects class-based narrowness.}

  Abstract                 = {Researchers, theorists, practitioners, and policy makers have shown interest in better preparing students to self-regulate their learning. In educational psychology, researchers have developed a number of pedagogical models and instructional strategies designed to facilitate students' self-regulated learning (SRL). This effort is demonstrative of the growing trend to make SRL more widespread and systematic within education, that is, to make SRL an institutional goal. In this analysis, four sociological perspectives are used-functionalism, neo-Marxism, symbolic interactionism, and cultural reproduction theory-to consider some of the complexities associated with institutionalizing SRL. These perspectives help to illuminate some of the conceptual nuances of SRL and the pedagogical complexities associated with teaching SRL.},

This study employed latent growth curve (LGC) modeling to examine (a) the degree to which youth improved on indicators of adjustment over the course of the first year of enrollment in MeckCARES, and (b) the services or demographic variables associated with individual differences in the rate of change over time. Participant caregivers (N = 121) reported on 3 major indicators of youth adjustment at baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up. Primary analyses indicated that there was a modest yet significant improvement in all 3 outcome measures over the first year of enrollment in MeckCARES. Additional analyses revealed that caregiver reports of receiving case management at any point in the first year were associated with improvement in behavioral and emotional strengths as well as a reduction in psychological and behavioral symptoms. No significant differences in rate of change were observed based on caregiver-reported receipt of individual or family therapy nor any demographic variables. These findings suggest that MeckCARES may be particularly effective when youth are receiving case management services. Additional implications for practice are discussed.

Data from 3,143 predominantly female high school students recruited from 40 Australian secondary schools were analyzed using latent growth curve modeling. Significant differences in the psychological factors between the 555 participants with a history of NSSI and non-self-injurers were reported at baseline. Self-injurers experienced significantly greater accumulation of life stressors over time compared with non-self-injurers. After controlling for adverse life events, psychological distress and other emotion regulation strategies, use of cognitive reappraisal at baseline was associated with less severe NSSI presentations, and slower growth in medical severity of NSSI over time. Findings indicate that while both cohorts have similar emotion regulation trajectories, adolescents who self-injure start off at a disadvantage and have a propensity to engage in less helpful processes that tend to heighten negative emotional states. Results recommend increasing focus on improving adolescents{\textquoteright} frequency and skills in use of cognitive reappraisal in efforts to reduce NSSI among this population.

Specifically, issues related to choice of variables, data preparation and problems such as data clustering are addressed. Interpretation of results and methods of classifying households into SES groups are also discussed. PCA has been validated as a method to describe SES differentiation within a population. Issues related to the underlying data will affect PCA and this should be considered when generating and interpreting results.},

In this context, we provide an overview of the nStudy software system, a web application that offers learners a wide array of tools for identifying and operating on information they study. We designed nStudy to be a laboratory for learners and researchers alike to explore learning skills, metacognition and self-regulated learning. As learners use nStudy{\textquoteright}s tools to study information in the Internet or researchers{\textquoteright} specially prepared HTML material, nStudy logs fine-grained, time-stamped trace data that reflect the cognitive and metacognitive events in self-regulated learning. Next steps in work on the nStudy system are to add tools learners that provide feedback they can use to advance personal programs of research on improving learning skills and gainfully self-regulating learning.},

  Abstract                 = {Situated learning can enable learners to interact with real world objects, deepen their impression of learning material, and establish a connection between those objects and the material. For the practice of English reading, a proper integration of learner portfolios and local environments, along with a sound reading strategy, not only strengthens the students{\textquoteright} understanding of language and reading comprehension, but also improves the effectiveness of language learning. Extended from the methodology of situational language, this study developed a ubiquitous English reading learning system based on RFID-based location-aware technology and a portfolio-centric article reading guide. Through RFID technology, the learning system can detect a learner{\textquoteright}s location; it then sends the learner highly situational and relevant English articles to read and study. Linking to the local environment, the English content becomes more perceivable, helping students achieve situational learning: {\textquotedblleft}what is seen is read.{\textquotedblright} Concurrent with the mechanism for situated reading articles, this work conducted an analysis of learner study portfolios incorporating the average learner ability to obtain parameters of standing point. Using the genetic algorithm approach, the system evaluates the difficulty of articles and their relationships. Through multiple evolutionary sequences, the system eventually provides the learner with appropriate and progressive articles for personalized study. The experiment conducted in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations revealed that this learning system can effectively assist learners as they immerse themselves in the study.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional assessment ways like multiple choice tests have been used to evaluate students{\textquoteright} performance in English language teaching (ELT) at schools, but these assessment methods are not effective and efficient because they do not show the real performance of students. On the other hand, student-centeredness is the main focus of many teaching and learning methods and techniques used in ELT. It emphasizes learning by doing. As the main focus is on learning by doing, assessing this process requires different assessment methods that take factors, such as students{\textquoteright} understanding and personal difference into consideration, while evaluating learners{\textquoteright} performance. Therefore, educators need to develop new student-centred assessment methods to evaluate learners in ELT. One of these ways is the use of e-portfolios. E-portfolios can be used as an assessment in courses effectively to improve different learning styles of learners. One of them is self-regulated learning, which focuses on students{\textquoteright} taking responsibility for their learning from the beginning to the end. This process includes setting goals and organizing learning environments according to their determined goals, but finding research on the use of e-portfolios as an assessment tool in self-regulated learning in ELT is rare. Therefore, this paper aims to find out whether e-portfolio-based assessment can be used to improve students{\textquoteright} self-regulated learning through reviewing the literature. The result of the literature review indicates that e- portfolio-based assessment can develop students{\textquoteright} self-regulated learning in ELT.},

In comparison to boys they rate their action and problem solving competencies unrealistically low, which results, for example, in extremely low participation rates in scientific and technical studies and professions. For this reason differences in motivation and self-related cognitions become the focus of interest in explaining achievement differences. The present study was carried out prior to initial physics instruction. Students in the 7th grade of the German Gymnasium (243 girls and 282 boys) were divided according to their KFT 4-13+ results into {\textquotedblleft}average{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}gifted{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}highly gifted groups{\textquotedblright}. Prior to commencement of physics instruction, boys in general, as well as gifted male and female students, already possessed more knowledge of physics and more favourable motivation for the subject than girls or male and female students of average ability. In addition, domain specific measures and self-related cognitions were evaluated in accordance with Dweck's model of achievement motivation.},

In this article theoretical and practical problems in the evaluation of modifications in educational settings are discussed. Based on these considerations the ENDIT model of evaluation is presented. It comprises five minimal standards necessary for a convincing evaluation: 1) effect establishment, 2) control of the novelty effect, 3) discriminant validation, 4) superiority over compared to implicit control groups, and 5) time-delayed control group. The five standards are explained and their utility for research is demonstrated, by way of an example, through the evaluation of a visualization tool that was introduced in order to increase participation in an e-mentoring community. Participants in the investigation comprised 231 female high-school students participating in the e-mentoring community CyberMentor that aims at increasing interest and participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).},

According to Carol Dweck those students who subscribe to a fixed view of their abilities are particularly at risk. In this contribution we extended Dweck's framework and distinguished two aspects of the implicit theory of one's own abilities. We hypothesized that the negative consequences of a fixed view are limited to the belief that one's own deficits are stable. In contrast, we assumed that the belief in the stability of existing abilities as well as the belief in the modifiability of ability deficits is adaptive. In two longitudinal studies with students from grades 7 to 10 we found supportive evidence for the proposed distinction.},

  Abstract                 = {The European Language Portfolio (ELP) is an alternative assessment used in foreign language classes throughout Europe to support and record language learning. Directly linked to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Council of Europe, 2001) proficiency guidelines, it is designed to achieve an ambitious dual goal: document students' skills and foster self-regulated learners. The question remains whether the ELP accomplishes its desired effect. To investigate it, the researcher employed an embedded mixed methods design in Saxony, Germany, comprising a total of 575 students in 28 classes with 19 teachers in 6 schools. In a preliminary two-group quasi-experimental phase, students using the ELP (n = 318) reported higher mastery goal orientation, task value, academic self-efficacy, self-regulatory efficacy, and instructor evaluations. The ELP's effect increased with its frequency of use. Investigation into teachers' pedagogical beliefs revealed no statistical difference, strengthening the attribution of the results to ELP use. To reveal a more complete understanding of the ELP's effect, semi-structured interviews investigating student and teacher perception of the ELP were conducted with a purposefully selected subgroup of participants using the ELP. Interviews included open-ended prompts designed to illustrate the quantitative results. This study provides strong empirical evidence supporting the claim that the ELP accomplishes its pedagogical purpose. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
